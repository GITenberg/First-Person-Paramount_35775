<P CLASS="t3">
VIGOROUS DAUNT, BILLIONAIRE.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Newcastle Journal.</SPAN>&mdash;"Mr. Ambrose Pratt has with
conspicuous success followed up his previous ventures in the world
of romance with a tale that for sensation and daring originality
goes to the furthermost limit. 'Vigorous Daunt' is an amazing
creation."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Sheffield Telegraph.</SPAN>&mdash;"'Vigorous Daunt, Billionaire,'
is worthy of a place among the best of its kind. The book is capital
reading."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Scotsman.</SPAN>&mdash;"The novel is at once fresh, witty, ingenious,
and full of entertainment. In his portrayal of character and the
creation of incidents and situations, Mr. Pratt's audacity simply
defies criticism; he has given free rein, with literary taste, to a
vivacious imagination."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Dundee Courier.</SPAN>&mdash;"If you want innocent excitement
read 'Vigorous Daunt.' His wild adventures will make you grasp
your chair-arms as you read."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Hull Weekly News.</SPAN>&mdash;"Well written, this book is one
that can be well recommended. It is certain to keep the attention
and to prove attractive."
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
JAN DIGBY.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Financial Times.</SPAN>&mdash;"The book is written in a clear, lively
style, and as the interest is well sustained to the end, it should
enhance the author's already considerable reputation."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">People's Saturday Journal.</SPAN>&mdash;"A tale in no wise lacking in
human interest. From the first page to the last the tale grips,
and its pleasant humour is well handled and its cynicism will
appeal to all who like a breezy tale well told."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Bristol Times.</SPAN>&mdash;"Mr. Ambrose Pratt has given us of the
best of his work in this tale. We have not for some time read a
novel that interested and held us right through as this has done."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Glasgow Herald.</SPAN>&mdash;"The very considerable merit of the
story lies in its vivid picture of the resolutely adverse and conflicting
forces. Besides illustrating the author's grip of characterization,
the story gives fresh evidence of his descriptive vigour and
his literary accomplishment."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Northern Whig.</SPAN>&mdash;"A tale at once cleverly told and absorbingly
interesting throughout. It will appeal to all readers who relish
rapid movement and imaginative sweep of a writer who evidently
closely observes men and manners."
</P>

<BR>

<P CLASS="t3">
THE COUNTERSTROKE.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Daily Telegraph.</SPAN>&mdash;"Mr. Pratt is nothing if not startling.
In this story he unfolds amazing experiences in such a dauntless
and effective manner that he almost succeeds in making such
curious and furiously exciting adventures appear to be real."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Daily Graphic.</SPAN>&mdash;"In 'The Counterstroke' the author
has surpassed his previous efforts and given us a tale which is
daring in its conception and powerful in its narration. From the
first page, on which we are introduced to the 'Academy of ex-Ambassadors'
and Mr. Perigord, their mysterious master, down
to the last, the book never loses its hold upon the reader."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Dundee Advertiser.</SPAN>&mdash;"Ambrose Pratt is to be heartily
congratulated on the imaginary gifts and the marvellous ingenuity
displayed in his book. It is one of absorbing interest, and the
reader pursues with almost breathless eagerness the many and
varied experiences of Lord Francis Crossingham, the brave hero
of the book."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The People's Journal.</SPAN>&mdash;"There have been many Nihilist
novels written, but few which contain the grip and strength of
Mr. Ambrose Pratt's story. His plot is daring to a degree. It is
worked out with an ingenuity which cannot but appeal to all
those readers who like a cleverly-constructed romance in which
the interest is kept up to the end."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Evening News.</SPAN>&mdash;"A novel never to be forgotten."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Belfast Northern Whig.</SPAN>&mdash;"A story which keeps the reader
absorbed all the time."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Dublin Daily Express.</SPAN>&mdash;"A novel which should be
eagerly read, and anyone who reads it will look eagerly for further
books from Mr. Pratt's pen."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Newcastle Chronicle.</SPAN>&mdash;"Tremendously exciting."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Southport Visitor.</SPAN>&mdash;"Crowded with incident, is full of
excitement, and abounds in dramatic and delicate situations."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">Leeds Mercury.</SPAN>&mdash;"Written in vigorous and dashing style,
the story will certainly commend itself to a wide circle of readers."

THE HOUSE IN CURZON STREET
</H4>

<P>
My name is Agar Hume. My mother died when
I was two years old. My father was the first
violin in a second-rate music hall orchestra at Birmingham.
He had once been a gentleman. He
taught me French and how to play the flute. Between
whiles he treated me like a dog. He wished me to
become a member of his orchestra. My tastes, however,
inclined to the stage. From early childhood
I had possessed an almost perfect talent for mimicry.
When I was nineteen years old, there was not an
artist I had ever seen whom I could not represent
to the life. One morning, about that time, in a fit of
drunken rage my father gave me a terrible beating.
I was then somewhat undersized&mdash;the result of
irregular meals and bad food. I could neither
retaliate nor defend myself. That night, as soon as
my father had set off for the theatre, I ran away from
home. I walked to Liverpool, and easily obtained
employment at a music hall, where for three years
I nightly imitated every actor and person of note
whom the Liverpudlians wished to see. They grew
tired of me at last and ceased to applaud my turn.
I was promptly discharged by the management.
Not caring to return to Birmingham, as my father
had never forgiven me for deserting him, I made
my way to London. I had saved a little money, and
I thought that before it was spent I should procure a
new engagement. The London market, however,
was simply glutted with mimics, and before three
months had passed I was penniless and still without
a place. I haunted the theatres and employment
agencies to no purpose. I was obliged to pawn my
wardrobe, and at last a day came when I stood in
the Strand owning nothing in the world but the
suit of decent black I wore and my make-up box,
which I carried in my hand because I had been
turned out of my lodging-house that morning. I
had not tasted food for four-and-twenty hours. I
mentioned the latter fact ten minutes later to the
manager of the next employment agency I visited.
He had seen me so often that he knew me well, and
he sympathized with my misfortune.
</P>

<P>
"Look here," said he, "if you are so hard up as all
that, your only hope is to try your hand at something
else. There is no chance for you at the
theatres."
</P>

<P>
"I'm ready to turn boot-black!" I assured him.
</P>

<P>
"Well, well," said he, "a client of ours inquired
yesterday for a valet. If you are really willing to
put your pride in your pocket, I shall personally
recommend you."
</P>

<P>
"I have no pride," I answered, "but I have also
no experience."
</P>

<P>
He gave me a pitying smile. "Certainly not, but
I believe that you are hungry&mdash;you look it!"
</P>

<P>
I was so hungry indeed that I thanked him
warmly, and a few minutes afterwards I was walking
as fast as I could towards Piccadilly with a letter in
my pocket which bore the following address:&mdash;"Sir
William Dagmar, Bart., 22a Curzon Street."
</P>

<P>
It was a small two-storied house, but it looked
good, and I raised the knocker tremblingly.
</P>

<P>
A footman opened the door, to whom I gave my
precious letter. He was civil because my clothes
were well cut, and because I have the appearance of
a gentleman. He invited me to a seat in an anteroom,
and went off with my letter. When he returned,
he carried his nose in the air, and his bearing
was unaffectedly contemptuous.
</P>

<P>
"Huh!" he sniffed. "Step this way, but wipe
your shoes on that mat first, please!"
</P>

<P>
I obeyed. He led me to a room on the first floor,
opened the second door and announced in an oily
voice
</P>

<P>
"The valet&mdash;Sir William."
</P>

<P>
Had I been a man of pride, I should have felt
offended. As it was I walked into the room quite
undisturbed, and with the most respectful mien I
was able to assume.
</P>

<P>
The door closed behind me. The walls of the
room, which was a large one, were piled from floor
to ceiling with books, which ran in long straggling
tiers, on shelves of carven oak. Books littered the
carpet about the bases of the shelves. Rows of
books lying one upon another, were heaped upon an
immense table that occupied the centre of the room.
Dust covered the books. A revolving bookcase
crammed with books stood beside the chair upon
which Sir William Dagmar sat. The apartment resembled,
except for its air of general untidiness,
nothing so much as a corner in the British Museum
library. It possessed no windows, and was lighted
from the roof like a gallery of pictures. I am a
keenly observant man by nature, and from a lad I
had persistently developed my peculiar faculty
for the sake of my profession. At that time it was
only necessary for me to glance at a place, person or
thing in order to photograph its character and details
on my mind. A second after I entered the room I
looked at Sir William, but I had already said to
myself: "A book-worm!"
</P>

<P>
So he appeared, and nothing to my surprise. He
was of middle size and age. His features were regular
and even handsome. His complexion was yellow
and bloodless. He possessed a broad rather high
forehead, and a large head covered with a mass of
stubbly iron-grey hair. His nose was long and
straight. His chin was a trifle weak. He was clean
shaven. The key to his face was his mouth. It
was large and sensitive. It had a trick of screwing
itself up at the corners, and sending the upper lip
into a curl of sneering querulousness, which I immediately
experienced an itch to imitate. His teeth
were long, even and very white, but the right incisor
was lacking, and this circumstance made his voice
sound slightly sibilant. His eyes were grey like my
own, but they were set deeper in his head, and the
man had twice my weight of years stooping his
narrow shoulders.
</P>

<P>
He regarded me appraisingly. "I need a valet,"
he began. His voice was querulous like his mouth.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir," said I.
</P>

<P>
"You are recommended by Mr. Bray. You look
young&mdash;rather too young. Why did you leave your
last place?"
</P>

<P>
"My employer could not afford to keep me any
longer. I was with him for three years, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Show me your references."
</P>

<P>
I had expected that demand. "I gave them to
Mr. Bray, sir," I answered glibly. "Did he not send
them on to you? He said he would enclose them in
his letter!"
</P>

<P>
Sir William shook his head, and a bored look crept
into his eyes. "I suppose they are all right," he
muttered wearily. "I like your voice; it is soft.
If you want to please me never raise it. My head
aches very easily."
</P>

<P>
"I shall remember, sir," I answered in my mildest
accents.
</P>

<P>
"When could you commence your duties?"
</P>

<P>
"At once, sir."
</P>

<P>
He raised his eyebrows, then nodded languidly.
</P>

<P>
"Very well. I shall give you a trial. Your wages
will be £5 a month and your keep. Butts, the footman,
will show you to your room and explain my
ways to you. I shall ring when I require you."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir."
</P>

<P>
"By the way, Bray writes me that your name is
Agar Hume. I dislike it. Once upon a time I had a
friend named Hume. I shall call you Brown."
</P>

<P>
"Very good, sir."
</P>

<P>
I backed out of the room, and as I half expected
found the footman in the passage. His air of defiant
indifference informed me that he had been listening
through the keyhole. He was an owlish looking
creature, but there were garrulous wrinkles about
his eyes and lips which determined me to treat him
civilly.
</P>

<P>
"Sir William has engaged me, Mr. Butts," I said
in a low voice. "Will you be good enough to show
me to my room. I am to start work at once."
</P>

<P>
"You won't stay here long," he mumbled as he
tip-toed off. "They never do."
</P>

<P>
I had no intention of staying one day longer than I
could help. But I did not confide the fact to Butts.
As I followed him my one thought was to get my
hands on food as soon as possible. I was desperately
hungry. He took me upstairs to an attic room
at the back of the house. It was small, but well
lighted and clean, also it smelt of lavender. It contained
a deal wardrobe with a full length mirror, a
truckle bed, a dressing table and a wash stand. There
was also a carpet on the floor. I felt pleased, but I
was famished.
</P>

<P>
"Here you hare!" growled Butts.
</P>

<P>
I put down my make-up box, and faced him.
</P>

<P>
"I should like to be friends with you, Mr. Butts,"
I said. "I dare say we shall be cast a good deal in
each other's company. What do you say?" I
offered him my hand.
</P>

<P>
He grinned and took it. My apparent ingenuousness
had melted him at once. He was not a bad
hearted fellow, it seemed.
</P>

<P>
"All right," he said. "What's yer name?"
</P>

<P>
"Brown."
</P>

<P>
"What did yer think of 'im," he jerked his thumb
over his shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"A book-worm, isn't he&mdash;but what do you say if
we discuss him over a glass of beer and some bread
and cheese?"
</P>

<P>
"Good!" said Butts, and with an alacrity that
delighted me, he led the way by the servants' staircase
to the pantry on the ground floor. For beer,
however, he gave me port wine, and for bread and
cheese a cold partridge.
</P>

<P>
"You seem to live well here," I commented with
my mouth full.
</P>

<P>
"So so!" answered Butts with a sigh. "Tucker's
all right&mdash;but it's so cursed lonely. Master never
goes out, except to meals, and it's very seldom he
hever has any company here, honly about once a
month."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! a bit of a hermit, eh?"
</P>

<P>
"A bloomin' misanthrope&mdash;that's what I call
him! He 'ates noise like poison. Hif I was to drop
a plate 'e'd ring to know what the devil I meant by
it?"
</P>

<P>
"Married?"
</P>

<P>
"No. He 'ates women wors'n noise, I believe."
</P>

<P>
"How does he pass his time?"
</P>

<P>
"Reads all day&mdash;half the night too."
</P>

<P>
"What does he want with a valet, then?"
</P>

<P>
"You'll soon find out," said Butts with a snort of
contempt.
</P>

<P>
"Please tell me."
</P>

<P>
Butts wagged his head. "Bar shavin' him you
won't 'ave much to do, 'cept give him his medicines
at the proper hours. He's a sick man is Sir William
Dagmar! The last valet 'e had here, Joe Bates, was
a real smart un he was. He'd done for Lord X&mdash;&mdash; and
Mr. Francis, and a lot more tip-toppers. He was
just celebrated for fixing hevenin' dress ties; and
Sir William always wears ready made ones to save
trouble. Bates got the miserables in a week, an'
hup an' cleared out before the fortnight was
up."
</P>

<P>
"What is the matter with Sir William?"
</P>

<P>
"Consumption! He's got it bad!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh! is he rich?"
</P>

<P>
"Rich as Croesus."
</P>

<P>
"Any relatives?"
</P>

<P>
"A cousin he 'ates wors'n noise and wors'n women.
A young chap name o' Sefton Dagmar. He's heir
to the title, but I'm not thinkin' he'll get much o' the
splosh. Sir William's got it all in Government bonds
and he can leave it as he likes."
</P>

<P>
"What is this Sefton Dagmar like?"
</P>

<P>
"Not a bad sort. He's always haffable enough
to me. He lives at Newhaven, but he calls here once
in a while to see how Sir William is. But he hardly
ever sees him. Hi! there's master's bell&mdash;I'll be
back in a minute."
</P>

<P>
As soon as Butts had disappeared I gave my appetite
free rein and a very hearty meal I made. He
was absent a quarter of an hour, and on his return he
wore a look of annoyance. "Nuisance!" he began.
"He's halways worriting about this time. He's goin'
to give a dinner party to-morrow night. He gives
one every month. But he wants you! Hurry up,
he 'ates to be kep waitin'."
</P>

<P>
I was up the stairs in a twinkle, and again standing
before Sir William. He looked bored to death.
</P>

<P>
"Some gentlemen will dine with me to-morrow
night, Brown," he drawled. "Six in all. Their
names are on this paper, and their table places
marked. I wish you to serve&mdash;Butts is a clumsy
waiter."
</P>

<P>
I received the paper with a deferential bow.
"Very good, sir!" I murmured.
</P>

<P>
"You will also see that card tables are arranged
in the smoking room. Butts will order the dinner,
he knows my ways. But you will take charge of the
arrangements. You seem a capable young fellow."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"And Brown," he frowned heavily.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Don't fill my glass too often. I am an invalid,
you know, and wine does not agree with me. That
is all. I shall not want you again until seven o'clock
this evening, when you may dress me for dinner!"
</P>

<P>
Butts and I studied the paper that Sir William
had given me, with the greatest attention. I soon
gathered that the six gentlemen who were to dine
with my master were not members of the smart
set of society such as Butts called "tip-toppers,"
but men of intellectual attainment, and leaders of
thought, if not of fashion. Butts knew them all.
"They belong to Sir William's club, the 'Athenian,'"
he remarked. "This here Sir Charles Venner who's
to take the seat of honour is a cove what cuts up
dead dogs and such like while they are alive."
</P>

<P>
"A vivisectionist?" I asked smiling.
</P>

<P>
"Don't know what you call 'em," responded
Butts. "But he's doctor, and so is Mr. Fulton,
who is to sit opposite on master's left. The next
chap on the right&mdash;Luke Humphreys&mdash;is a hauthor,
on political economy. Mr. Husband is the chap
who wrote that article in the <i>National Review</i> on
the weakness of the Navy, which kicked up such a
blessed fuss a while since. You must have heard of
him?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, yes."
</P>

<P>
"Well, George Cavanagh is an artist and a R.A.
Master has one of his pictures in the dining room&mdash;you'll
see it presently: a naked woman with a chap&mdash;'Love
and Death' it's called."
</P>

<P>
I had much ado not to laugh outright. "I've
seen prints of it," I muttered. "Who is the last,
Mr. Nevil Pardoe, Butts?"
</P>

<P>
"He's a playwright," answered Butts with a sigh.
"They're playin' one of his pieces now at the Kensington
Theatre. I went there the other night and
got my pocket picked for my trouble." He kicked
over a chair as he spoke, as if carried away by temper
in remembering his misfortune. The bell rang on
instant. "Oh, Lor!" groaned Butts. "I'm in for
it again, that man has the ears of a mole!"
</P>

<P>
He came back a few minutes later looking very
sour. "Called me a clod hopper!" he growled in a
low voice. "He's got a reptile tongue. But come
upstairs, Brown, and I'll show you his bedroom&mdash;an'
where he keeps his clothes an' things!"
</P>

<P>
It was an immense apartment, magnificently
furnished. But it was very untidy and medicine
bottles, some full, some empty, crowded the mantelpiece
and dressing tables. The place smelt like a
druggist's store. "I'll clear that rubbish away first
thing," I declared. But the footman seized my arm
as I caught up the first bottle. "He'd go ravin'
stark starin' mad if one of them was shifted," he
cried. "Don't you touch 'em, lad."
</P>

<P>
I shrugged my shoulders, and watched Butts ransack
our master's wardrobe, he explaining to me the
while certain preferences in matters of taste and
dress which Sir William had always manifested. It
appeared that he detested colours. All his suits
were black, also his boots and gloves.
</P>

<P>
"You seem to know him so well, Butts," I remarked
at last, "that I wonder more and more why
he has not made you his valet."
</P>

<P>
"It's my haccent!" sighed Butts. "He can't
abear it. Whenever I drop a haitch, in his 'earing,
he shrivels up."
</P>

<P>
During the afternoon I borrowed half a sovereign
from Butts, and purchased some fresh linen.
</P>

<P>
While dressing Sir William Dagmar later in the
evening, I only spoke when he addressed me, and
then in softest monosyllables. He seemed pleased
with my attentions. But then I have frequently
noticed that no man is hard to please whose idiosyncrasies
are humoured when detected. He gave me a
list of his medicines and the hours when they should
be administered, after which he departed to dine at
a neighbouring restaurant, in which his habit was
to take most of his meals in a private room, perfectly
alone.
</P>

<P>
Butts and I dined together in the pantry, and a
merry time we spent, until our master's return, when
noise was prohibited.
</P>

<P>
On the morrow the house was more or less in the
hands of a bevy of restaurateurs preparing for the
dinner. Sir William went out early in the morning,
and he was absent all day, but he returned in time
for me to dress him, and he appeared to be pleased
with our arrangements. The table indeed looked
magnificent, for I had taken care to deck it with
flowers, and my taste in such matters is excellent.
I did not see the guests until dinner was served, and
they were all seated at the table. I wore an evening
suit of my master's, which on Butts' advice I had
borrowed beforehand without the formality of asking
permission, having none of my own. Sir William
was not an observant man, <i>grace au Dieu</i>! I entered
the room noiselessly, and slipped behind my master's
chair. The table had been previously spread
with oysters. No one spoke, until the shells were
emptied; meanwhile I studied the six attentively.
They were intelligent, but cold-faced men. Sir
Charles Venner had an enormous nose, and very small
grey eyes. Dr. Fulton possessed a hare-lip. Mr.
Humphreys rejoiced in a squint. George Cavanagh
might have stepped from a portrait by Van Dyck,
but he had a trick of screwing up the tip of his
nose under the influence of excitement, at intervals,
as a rabbit does. Mr. Husband put out his tongue,
to meet his fork as he ate, he possessed a prodigious
chin; and Mr. Nevil Pardoe had watchful heavy
lidded eyes. These traits were their key-notes so to
speak&mdash;their individual and predominant peculiarities,
which distinguished them from each other and
from other distinguished men. From the rest of the
world, they were one and all distinguished by a common
pallor of complexion, and a curious cough, which
stamped them as consumptives.
</P>

<P>
As I removed their plates, Sir Charles Venner
broke a silence that I at least was beginning to find
oppressive. "I believe you will be the first to go
after all, Dagmar!" he remarked in French, casting
a keen glance at my master. "Pardoe seems picking
up. He doesn't cough so much to-night." It
was evident that no one suspected me of an acquaintanceship
with French.
</P>

<P>
Sir William shrugged his shoulders. "I am ready,"
he returned. "But I don't think so. Will you bet,
or any one?"
</P>

<P>
"I'll lay you even money that Pardoe turns up his
toes before you, Dagmar!" cut in Mr. Husband.
</P>

<P>
"Very good," said Sir William. "How much?"
</P>

<P>
"A hundred!"
</P>

<P>
"It is a wager!" Sir William took out his pencil
and scrawled some figures on his shirt cuff.
</P>

<P>
"I'll take you too, Husband," cried Mr. Cavanagh.
</P>

<P>
"And I," chorused Dr. Fulton and Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
"No thanks," retorted Mr. Husband drily. "My
book is full. How are you feeling yourself, Venner?"
</P>

<P>
"Nice and poorly, thanks, but with care I'll out-last
the lot of you!" He broke out into a fit of
coughing as he finished speaking, and the others
bending forward, watched him eagerly. Their expressions
reminded me of a lot of hungry carnivora
eyeing a bone held just beyond their reach.
</P>

<P>
They drank their soup in silence, but while I
served to them the entrée, they conversed again.
</P>

<P>
"I'm in the hands of a quack," began Nevil
Pardoe. "The enterprising devil has agreed to cure
me for the sake of an advertisement."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! How long?"
</P>

<P>
"Ten days now. Upon honour I feel a little better
already."
</P>

<P>
"Where is he to be found?" demanded my master
suddenly.
</P>

<P>
A roar of laughter drowned the reply. But Sir
William looked annoyed. "It's not that I want to
live," he explained in tones of anger. "I know I'm
doomed, but Cavanagh stands to lose two thousand
pounds&mdash;if I predecease Pardoe, and as he is only a
poor devil of an artist&mdash;I'd like to improve his
chances!"
</P>

<P>
"Quite so," sneered Sir Charles. "We all know
your affection for Cavanagh. But my dear Dagmar,
fair play is a jewel you know. You must kill or cure
yourself off your own bat, unless you choose to pair
with Pardoe and adopt his treatment altogether.
Those are the rules."
</P>

<P>
"You need not remind me," said my master drily.
"By the way, Husband, what was the result of your
last examination?"
</P>

<P>
"Two pounds short of my former weight, but the
hole in my remaining lung has not sensibly increased.
Jackson gives me solid assurance of at least twelve
months."
</P>

<P>
"Lucky devil!" sighed Mr. Cavanagh. "I'm
booked in half the time, though I might drag on for
a year or two if I were to try Egypt!"
</P>

<P>
"Has your limit been changed since our last meeting,
Fulton," asked Mr. Pardoe.
</P>

<P>
"Only by effluxion of the intervening time. I'll
feed the worms in just under ten months, unless a
cab runs over me, or some other accident occurs."
</P>

<P>
Sir William raised his wineglass. "Gentlemen,"
said he, "I drink to the Tubercle Bacillus!"
</P>

<P>
"Our master!" chorused the others, and every
glass was drained.
</P>

<P>
I quickly refilled all but Sir William's, wondering
the while whether I had fallen among an assembly of
ghouls, or if I was not the victim of some ghastly
joke. The <i>pièce de résistance</i> of the dinner was
a dressed calf's head, which Sir William Dagmar
carved. Not one of his guests began to eat until all
were helped. But when that was done, my master
suddenly ordered me to leave the room. Butts
regarded me enquiringly as I came out. "Spoke
some foreign lingo, didn't they?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
I nodded.
</P>

<P>
"They allers do," he went on. "Why, I don't
know, for the life o' me. A lot of death's heads I
call them."
</P>

<P>
"They look like consumptives," I suggested.
</P>

<P>
"Like as not they hare!" he returned. "Look
at this muss, Brown! What do you make of
it?"
</P>

<P>
He held up a huge bowl of cream into which a
hundred different species of nuts had been grated.
"This is what they take for sweets," he said with a
shiver. "It tastes 'orrible!"
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps it is medicine."
</P>

<P>
"May be. I spose you didn't make out hanything
they said, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
"They spoke in French, Butts," I replied.
</P>

<P>
He shrugged his shoulders, and we waited for the
bell. When it rang I took in the bowl of nut cream.
</P>

<P>
"Do you understand French, Brown?" demanded
my master as soon as the door closed behind
me.
</P>

<P>
"Not a word, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Very good. Serve the sweets, please."
</P>

<P>
A murmur of approval went round the table. The
gentlemen ate their cream in silence, and washed it
down with champagne. I refilled their glasses with
the dexterity of an expert waiter, and I was about
to resume my old place behind my master's chair,
when he fixed me with his eyes, and addressed me
suddenly in French. "Brown!" cried he, "leave
the room this instant!"
</P>

<P>
I halted and looked at him with a stupid air.
"Beg pardon, sir. Did you speak to me, sir?"
</P>

<P>
He smiled and answered in English. "Yes,
Brown, fill my glass please. I forgot that you do
not understand French!"
</P>

<P>
"You should have tested the fellow beforehand,"
said Sir Charles Venner in French. "The closer you
approach your tomb, Dagmar, the more careless you
become!"
</P>

<P>
"What does it matter," said my master wearily.
"Pardoe, kindly present your report!"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Pardoe got slowly to his feet, and I marvelled
to see for the first time, his lean ungainly frame.
A bag of skin and bone it was, no more. A frightful
fit of coughing preluded his speech. When he had
recovered, he put his right foot on a chair, and leaning
on his bony knee, began as follows:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Gentlemen, this is our seventeenth monthly
gathering since the initiation of our order, and we are
all, seven of us, still above ground, although we were all
condemned as incurable before we first foregathered.
During the period I have indicated not one of us
has flinched from his bargain, and as your latest
secretary, gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that
I have duly and regularly received from each member
the weekly contribution fixed by our rules. The
amount at present standing to my credit in trust for
the order is £7,000." He took a small pass-book
from his pocket, and handed it to his nearest neighbour,
who glanced at its contents and passed it up
the table to Sir William. "You will find in that
book, gentlemen, a cheque for the amount named
marked 'good' by the Bank. I have the honor now
to tender you my resignation. Mr. Cavanagh should,
I believe, be my successor."
</P>

<P>
He sat down again, coughing terribly.
</P>

<P>
Sir William nodded. "It is your turn, Cavanagh,"
he said quietly. "You will hold office for the current
month."
</P>

<P>
"Very well," replied Mr. Cavanagh, tugging
fiercely at his moustache as he spoke. "You fellows
can forward your subs, direct to my studio,
without waiting for notices. I never write letters."
</P>

<P>
Sir William arose, holding the cheque above his
head. "Whose shall it be this time, friends?" he
demanded. "Remember that I have won three
times running. Will any give me odds?"
</P>

<P>
"I," cried Dr. Fulton sharply. "I'll lay you
seven to one in hundreds, Dagmar, that you do not
win to-night."
</P>

<P>
"Done! Come, gentlemen."
</P>

<P>
They trooped out of the room, and I, ablaze with
curiosity, made haste to follow them, carrying a
silver tray of coffee and liqueurs with which Butts
supplied me.
</P>

<P>
I found them standing around the larger card-table,
watching, in perfect silence, Mr. Nevil Pardoe
shaking an iron dice-box. Upon the middle of the
cloth lay the cheque for £7,000 face upwards, which
Mr. Pardoe had given to Sir William. No one
heeded me, so I put down the tray and watched
them. Presently Mr. Pardoe scattered the dice upon
the cloth.
</P>

<P>
"Five," said Mr. Cavanagh, picking up the dice.
"Your turn, Sir Charles."
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles took up the box, scarcely rattled it,
and threw.
</P>

<P>
"Six," said Mr. Cavanagh. "Dr. Fulton."
</P>

<P>
The doctor threw eleven; Mr. Husband five; Mr.
Humphreys thirteen, and Mr. Cavanagh sixteen.
</P>

<P>
When the latter's fortune was declared, Dr. Fulton
rubbed his hands together. "He! he! he! beat
that, Dagmar!" he chuckled.
</P>

<P>
Sir William took up the box for half a minute,
and scattered the pieces without looking at the
board.
</P>

<P>
"Seventeen!" said Mr. Cavanagh in a stifled
voice. The poor young man's face was a ghastly
sight to witness. He had evidently made sure of
winning, and the snatching of the cup from his lips
had cost him a month of his fast dwindling life, or
his looks belied him. He sank into a chair and began
to cough so violently that a bloody foam soon
stained the handkerchief he held before his mouth.
</P>

<P>
Sir William, with a curiously blank smile, took up
the cheque and slipped it into his pocket. "I'll
trouble you for seven hundred pounds at your leisure,
Fulton," he said quietly.
</P>

<P>
"I'll post it," snapped the doctor. "May the furies
seize your luck! That is the fourth time in succession
you have fleeced us!"
</P>

<P>
The others shrugged their shoulders, and sought
chairs, which they drew about the board. I served
them immediately with coffee. A moment later,
each had a pile of bank-notes and gold before him,
and at the centre of the table, in a little cup-like depression,
lay a heap of sovereigns. The game was
draw poker. It was a strange experience for me to
watch them. All seven seemed gamblers born. All
had death in their faces, and were living only by the
grace of their disease. All were men of uncommon
intellect. They played with a rigid affectation of
indifference, that poorly concealed their underlying
eagerness. They only spoke to bet, and the stakes
ran high. From the first Sir William Dagmar won.
His luck was marvellous. Standing as I did behind
his chair, I could see his cards and his opponents'
faces. Twice running, four queens were dealt him.
Each time he won a considerable sum, and each time
six pair of wolfish eyes detested his good fortune.
Twice again he drew for a flush, and made it. On
the latter occasion, two of his opponents held full
hands&mdash;Sir Charles Venner and Mr. Cavanagh. The
others passed out, but Venner and Cavanagh bet to
the limit, a hundred pounds. Sir William called
them, and with his customary blandness, scooped
the pool. They arose, with muttered curses, to their
feet, and became spectators. Half an hour later the
game broke up. Sir William had despoiled the last
of his guests, and his pockets simply bulged with
money.
</P>

<P>
"It is an omen!" he declared. "I now believe
that I shall be the first to go! Fate is fond of such
little ironies! Brown," he added in English. "Help
these gentlemen to don their cloaks. My friends,
good-night."
</P>

<P>
They replied with the curtest of nods, and I attended
them from the house.
</P>

<P>
While I was undressing my master I racked my
brains to try to discern a means of turning to my own
advantage what I had seen and heard that night.
Sir William seemed worn out, and he got into bed
immediately. But as I was about to extinguish the
gas, he called me to him. "Well, Brown," said he,
"what do you think of my luck?"
</P>

<P>
"Wonderful, sir!" I replied, "simply wonderful."
</P>

<P>
He nodded, and a sneer curled his lips. "In this
life, Brown," he muttered, "the things we neither
need nor desire are oftenest showered upon us. Be
good enough to count my winnings."
</P>

<P>
I obeyed, eyeing him covertly the while. But he
had turned his back, and appeared to pay me no
heed.
</P>

<P>
"Seven thousand six hundred and thirteen
pounds," I announced at last.
</P>

<P>
He glanced round at me, a smile upon his face.
"I am glad to see that you are an honest man,
Brown," he said quietly. "That will do&mdash;you may
go."
</P>

<P>
I had been bitterly tempted, but, well he had
turned his back upon me. Charmed with the result
of my astuteness, I left the room and sought my own.
There I occupied myself for a few minutes with my
make-up box, and when quite satisfied with my appearance,
I tip-toed down stairs to the pantry.
</P>

<P>
Butts was seated before a dainty meal, and in
the act of opening a bottle of champagne.
</P>

<P>
"Butts!" said I, "when did I give you permission
to drink my champagne?"
</P>

<P>
He sprang to his feet uttering a cry of terror, and
the bottle toppled over the table.
</P>

<P>
"Sir William!" he gasped, "Oh, sir; oh, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"Look at me!" I commanded.
</P>

<P>
His eyes almost bulged out of his head. "Is
there anything in my appearance?" I demanded,
"which might lead you to suppose that I am the
sort of man to allow my servants such indulgence."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sir. Please forgive me, sir!" he mumbled,
shaking like a leaf. "I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Dishonest in one thing, then in another," I interrupted
sternly. "How much did you steal in
providing to-night's dinner? Tell me the truth, or I
shall send for the police!"
</P>

<P>
"Not a penny sir&mdash;so&mdash;help me! The wine man
gave me two pounds commission on the order, that
is all, sir&mdash;so help me!"
</P>

<P>
"Hand it over to me at once, and let this be a
lesson to you!" I commanded.
</P>

<P>
Butts, trembling, placed two sovereigns in my outstretched
palm.
</P>

<P>
"Was Brown a partner in your rascality?" I
demanded.
</P>

<P>
"No&mdash;no, sir," he stammered. "Oh! oh!
please forgive me, sir. I'll never do it again, sir&mdash;so
help me!" The fellow actually fell on his knees
before me, and tears of entreaty rolled down his
cheeks.
</P>

<P>
"I'll forgive you this once!" I returned, and
swinging on my heel, I left the pantry.
</P>

<P>
Ten minutes later Butts poured into my ears a
wild tale of how Sir William Dagmar had caught
him opening a bottle of champagne, and of the row
that they had had. But he told me nothing about
the two sovereigns reposing that instant in my
pocket.
</P>

<P>
I went to sleep that night perfectly self-satisfied,
and so reconciled with my position as Sir William
Dagmar's valet, that I would not have changed
places with Dan Leno himself. I had formed a fine
plan to enrich myself, and I determined to abandon
the stage for ever.

THE FOUNDATION OF A FORTUNE
</H4>

<P>
The next month passed very quietly. I got
used to Sir William and his ways, and so
assiduously attended him that I had the satisfaction
to perceive that my services were gradually becoming
indispensable to his comfort. I studied
him so closely that before long I was able almost to
read his thoughts, certainly to anticipate his wishes.
I waited upon him like a shadow, as silently, as
faithfully. His life was for the most part of fixed
habit. At nine o'clock he arose and breakfasted.
He then repaired to his library where he read or
wrote until noon. I found that he was engaged in
compiling a compendium of philosophy, one volume
of which had already been published and which had
procured for him a great measure of literary fame.
His heart was wrapped up in his work. It had
more charms to him than the love of woman to an
abandoned rake, or dice to a gambler. Once
seated there before his manuscript he permitted
nothing to interrupt him, except noise&mdash;at which
he raged like a madman. I have seen him bend
murderous glances on Butts&mdash;entering by chance
with some persistent visitor's pasteboard. I, however,
came and went as I pleased with his medicines,
which I obliged him to take at the proper hours.
For me he had always a smile, impatient truly, but a
smile; for I wore shoes of felt, and from careful
practice my voice became more softly modulated
every day. At noon Sir William went out for a
walk in the park, and for lunch at his restaurant.
He returned at three and worked steadily until
seven, when I dressed him for dinner, for which he
also went abroad. From ten o'clock until midnight
he worked again, when I put him to bed. Such
was our daily round for six days in every week. On
the seventh Sir William arose an hour earlier than
usual, and immediately after breakfast he left the
house and seldom returned until past midnight.
What he did or where he went on those occasions
I could not by any means discover, for Butts was as
ignorant as I, and I dared not ask our master. I
determined that one day in the near future I would
follow him, but I could not do so immediately,
because of Butts. Visitors came to the house at
times, but he seldom received any, and if he saw his
friends at all it must have been during meals. I
directed my leisure hours to the perfection of the
plan I had formed for my own aggrandisement.
In that behalf I prosecuted diligent inquiries concerning
the six gentlemen who were my master's
monthly guests. I could learn very little of them
it is true, try how I would, and nothing at all of the
curious link of agreement which I knew bound them
together. But I found that they were all men of
private fortune and of great esteem in the world of
learning; also that each of them, like my master,
was passionately devoted to a particular intellectual
hobby horse. Sir Charles Venner, it seemed, had
already spent ten years of research in extending the
acquaintance of science with the functions of the
thyroid gland. Dr. Fulton's ambition was to discover
some great destructive to the bacillus of
bubonic plague, yet otherwise harmless to the
human system. Mr. Humphreys was engaged upon
a propagandist mission to teach the masses the
blessings of what he called "Purer Socialism." Mr.
Cavanagh painted riddles of pictures for the
Academy, which his brother Academicians wished,
without daring, to reject. Mr. Nevil Pardoe wrote
problem plays, and Mr. Husband was a naval expert.
Like my master, all were confirmed bachelors
who had acquired a reputation for misogyny because
they remorselessly eschewed society. Earnest
workers and infernal idiots! So I came to
regard them the more I heard of them. Indeed,
who but a fool would prefer to waste his life in
barren study, when he might squire instead such
exquisitely beautiful dames as I saw and coveted
every time I wandered down Piccadilly or the
Row?
</P>

<P>
The secret of my master's monthly entertainments
cost me many an unquiet night of puzzled
thought and anxious contemplation. I tried to
believe that he and his six fellow students had
simply agreed to assemble periodically at Sir William
Dagmar's house in order to enjoy a quiet gamble as
a recreation from their ordinary and persistent
labours, and also to gratify a morbid desire of
marking the ravages which their common disease had
made in each other since their last meeting. Some
instinct, however, forbade me to rest satisfied with
an explanation so simple. Why, I asked myself,
should they always converse in French, if they had
nothing better worthy of concealing? Why, again,
should they subscribe weekly to a common fund,
the combined fruits of which evidently passed into
one man's keeping at the dictation of the dice?
That seemed a curious thing, and it was a circumstance
all the more puzzling to account for, since
they gambled at cards for high stakes as well. Was it
just possible that the winner of the cheque was bound,
by rule, to apply the money to some esoteric purpose?
I felt inclined to suspect it was! But what then?
I watched Sir William, the last winner of the cheque,
as a cat might a mouse for three weeks&mdash;but I discovered
nothing. I censored his correspondence
with a like result. Every Monday morning he
gave me a letter to post to Mr. Cavanagh. I opened
those over a bowl of steam, but each only contained
a crossed and unnegotiable cheque for £250, with
never a line of explanation. As for the rest of his
post budget, he received many letters, but he answered
none, and his correspondents seemed to be
for the most part beggars. The mystery irritated
me so much that it began to trouble my sleep.
Butts also annoyed me. He developed such a
fancy for my company that I was obliged to lock
my door whenever I wished to be alone; and I frequently
wished to be alone, for my great plan required
that I should be able to imitate at will Sir
William Dagmar's every look and gesture, his
every tone and trick of speech. I foresaw that I
should have to get rid of Butts. He was a naturally
inquisitive, interfering fellow. But I reflected that
when I had got rid of him, it would be necessary for
me to perform his duties as well as my own, if I wished
to have a clear field for my designs. If Sir William
engaged another footman, I should have my work
to do all over again. With that end in view, I
persuaded Butts to instruct me in the business of
ordering and providing the monthly dinners, cleaning
silver, and so forth. Pride is not one of my
weaknesses, as I have remarked before. I felt able
to assume his post in a very few days, just two days
indeed before the next monthly dinner was due.
That very night I dressed myself up to resemble
my master, and marched stealthily downstairs into
the pantry about the hour when I knew, from experience,
that Butts enjoyed a first night-cap of port
wine. There he stood, a bottle before him, glass in
hand.
</P>

<P>
"Butts!" said I, without preliminary, "I was
wrong to forgive you for stealing my wine. But I
wished to give you a chance&mdash;No, don't speak to
me, Butts. You have had your chance and wasted
it. If you are not out of my house before breakfast
hour to-morrow, I shall give you in charge of the
police. If, however, you make the least noise in
taking your boxes downstairs, I shall prosecute you
in any case. Be careful, therefore! Good night,
Butts!"
</P>

<P>
I left him standing like a frozen image, staring
after me. Half an hour later he came to my room
and poured the whole story into my sympathetic
ears. He was almost drunk, and bitterly incensed
with my master, also he was terribly afraid of the
police. I sincerely commiserated with him, and
earned his undying gratitude by forcing into his
hand one of the sovereigns of which I had previously
despoiled him, and which I had had no occasion to
spend, for Butts had put me in the way of replenishing
my wardrobe on the credit system. I felt
truly sorry for Butts, but he had to go. He stood
in my way. My philosophy is embraced in the
maxim, "First person paramount." I may be
thought inhuman by some of the people who read
these memoirs, but I dare swear that none will consider
me a fool. The surest way to succeed in life is
to kick down as soon as may be the ladders by
which one climbs. To do otherwise is to court disaster,
for envy is the most powerful passion of the
soul, and envy is inevitably excited by contemplation
of the successes of our equals or inferiors.
</P>

<P>
When I had half dressed Sir William on the
following morning, I broke my fixed habit of
silence.
</P>

<P>
"If you please, sir," I said very softly, "I have
something to inform you which I fancy you should
know."
</P>

<P>
My master looked as much surprised as if he had
previously considered me to be a dummy.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" he curtly demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Butts left this morning, sir, soon after daylight,
in order to catch a train to the West. His closest
living relative is dying, I believe; I persuaded him
not to trouble you last night by asking your permission."
</P>

<P>
"What a cursed nuisance!" cried Sir William
with a frown. "I expect guests to dinner here
to-morrow night. When will Butts return?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't think he will come back, sir, he has
expectations of inheriting a little fortune; he has,
however, given me minute instructions regarding the
dinner, and if you will be good enough to confide
the matter to my hands, I think I can promise that
you'll not be disappointed!"
</P>

<P>
"You are an invaluable fellow, Brown," said my
master in tones of great relief. "Certainly, take
charge of everything. I know that I can trust
you."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir," I said demurely. "Will your
guests be the same as last time, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes!" He shrugged his shoulders and slipped
his arms into the coat I held out for him.
</P>

<P>
"And will they be placed at table as before, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"Exactly. But what about my breakfast this
morning, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
"It will be ready for you in five minutes, sir."
</P>

<P>
I slipped out of the room and hurried down
stairs. I had not studied my master's tastes for
nothing. The breakfast I had prepared comprised
every dainty that he cared about, and the look of
surprise he cast about the table sufficiently rewarded
my forethought.
</P>

<P>
"Why, Brown," said he, as he sat down, "you
are a perfect treasure. If Butts does not return I
shall feel inclined to double your duties and your
pay. Some years ago I had a valet who managed
the whole house without assistance."
</P>

<P>
"I could do that," I assured him quietly. "There
is really only work here for one man, sir. Pardon
me for saying it, sir, but half my time so far has hung
upon my hands, and I detest being idle, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Well, well, we shall see," he replied. I felt
that I had gained my point and I said no more.
</P>

<P>
I made four pounds in spot cash by way of commission
in ordering the dinner. It was really very
easy. The restaurateurs were so anxious indeed to
secure my custom that I might have made more, but
I am not a greedy man, and four sovereigns seemed
a lot to me just then.
</P>

<P>
The dinner passed off much as the first had done.
Similar grisly jokes were interchanged in the French
tongue, and many bets were concluded between Sir
William and his guests. They toasted the tubercle
bacillus again, and after I had served the nut cream
Mr. Cavanagh handed a cheque for £7,000 to Sir
William and then resigned his office in favour of
Dr. Fulton, just as Mr. Pardoe had done upon the
former occasion. I noticed that Mr. Pardoe looked
very ill, frightfully ill, in fact, and his cough was
horrible to hear. It is true that all looked worse
than they had before, but Mr. Pardoe had outstripped
the others, and he was mercilessly rallied
on his appearance. The most consequential wager
was arranged between Mr. Humphreys and Sir
Charles Venner. The latter laid the former six to
four in hundreds that Mr. Pardoe would die within
the next month. I shall never forget Mr. Pardoe's
face as he listened. Its expression was indescribably
vexed and full of despair, but the others
roared with laughter to see it. As for me, I confess
that their laughter sickened me, and I had to slip out
of the room in order to recover my nerve. Such
monstrous disregard of a fellow creature's manifest
anguish inspired me with dismay and something
like terror. Were these people men of flesh and
blood, I asked myself, or ghouls? But my curiosity
was so poignant that I soon returned, and when
they trooped out to the card room I followed closely
at their heels.
</P>

<P>
The same formula was observed as upon the first
occasion that I had witnessed. The cheque was
placed upon the table and all gathered round to
watch and throw the dice.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner was the first to cast. As he
rattled the box he looked about him with a sort of
snarling smile. "By all the laws of chance it
should be my turn!" he declared. "I have never
won the incubus yet!"
</P>

<P>
He threw eighteen! The others exclaimed, but
Mr. Cavanagh did more. He stepped back from the
throng and gritting his teeth he threw out his
clenched hands with a gesture of savage abandon.
"There," said I to myself, "is a man who wishes
more passionately to win than the rest, but why?"
</P>

<P>
"Cavanagh, your turn," said Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
The artist's face was chalk white as he took up
the box. "You tremble!" cried Sir Charles in
mocking tones. "You tremble!"
</P>

<P>
"Bah!" exclaimed Mr. Cavanagh, and he threw.
</P>

<P>
"Eighteen!" shouted Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles flushed crimson, and swore beneath his
breath. But Mr. Cavanagh uttered a cry of triumph
that had yet in it a note of agony. I watched him
attentively thenceforward, because it suddenly occurred
to me that he would better repay such
trouble than the others. His passions were least
well controlled of any there. His was the weakest
face and most ingenuous. I determined that he
should be my key to the mystery I wished to solve.
He was a wonderfully handsome person, small, slight,
elegant, exquisite. His hair was thick and black,
but his moustache and pointed beard were of rich red
gold. He had large and singularly soulful eyes,
whose colour changed with light from black to
amber. His mouth, however, though full and beautifully
shaped, betrayed a vacillating and unstable
disposition. I judged him for a man to trust, to
admire, to like, but not to lean upon. He waited
for his turn to throw again in a fever of inquietude.
His hands clenched and unclenched. His features
spasmodically twitched and the tip of his nose
moved up and down with alarming speed. Not
any of the others was lucky enough to throw eighteen,
so presently Sir Charles Venner took up the dice
again. He looked perfectly indifferent, but I saw
his eyes, and they were gleaming. He allowed the
dice to fall one by one.
</P>

<P>
"Seven!" announced Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles bit his lip and handed the box in
silence to Mr. Cavanagh.
</P>

<P>
The latter threw eight. Dropping the box he
darted forward and clawed up the cheque, with a
strangled, animal-like cry. The others exchanged
glances of disgust; all, that is to say, except my
master. He shot a look of passionate menace at
the artist and called him in a dreadful voice by
name.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Cavanagh stood erect, shaking and ghastly.
He seemed convulsed with shame.
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;forgive me, I am not myself to-night," he
muttered.
</P>

<P>
"A fine, a fine," shouted Mr. Humphreys.
"He has pleaded his ill-health."
</P>

<P>
"Ay, ay," cried the others, "a fine!"
</P>

<P>
"Twenty pounds!" said Sir William Dagmar.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Cavanagh paid the money to my master
without demur. Sir William gave it to Dr. Fulton,
and a second later all were seated at the table.
</P>

<P>
I served them with coffee, and they began to play.
My master had no luck that night&mdash;he lost about
four hundred pounds. Mr. Cavanagh also lost
rather heavily, and so did Dr. Fulton. The principal
winners were Mr. Pardoe and Sir Charles Venner;
Mr. Humphreys left off as he commenced, while
Mr. Husband disgustedly declared that he had
won a paltry sovereign. As before, on the first
stroke of midnight the game broke up and all arose.
As before, no farewell greetings were exchanged,
but the guests departed after curtly nodding to
their host. My master looked more wearied than
I had ever seen him. He retired at once to bed, and
he was half asleep before he touched the pillow with
his head. But I was more than pleased thereat,
for the time was ripe to prosecute the first move of
my plan. As soon as he dismissed me, I hurried to
my room, and in less than twenty minutes I was Sir
William Dagmar to the life, save for one tiny circumstance.
My master, as I have previously mentioned,
possessed a fine set of teeth, but his right incisor was
lacking. When I had impersonated him for Butts'
benefit, that detail had not troubled me, for Butts
was a dull, unobservant creature. I reflected, however,
that Mr. Cavanagh might be of a different
calibre, and I dared run no risks. Now every tooth
in my head is false. Moreover, I was wearing at
that moment my stage set, which was so peculiarly
constructed that with very little bother and a
screw driver I might remove any tooth I pleased.
I therefore whipped out the plate from my mouth,
and with the aid of a penknife, I presently abstracted
my right incisor. A glance in the mirror made me
tingle with triumph. I believe that had Sir William
seen me at that moment he would have swooned
with sheer shock at seeing so perfect a double of
himself. Having provided myself with a latch-key,
I stole downstairs and abstracted from the hall my
master's hat and cloak. A few minutes afterwards
I was flying towards Mr. Cavanagh's studio and
residence at St. John's Wood, in a hansom, which I
chose wisely, for the horse was a speedy brute, and
he drew up at Hamilton Crescent in less than half
an hour.
</P>

<P>
In answer to my vigorous tug at the bell, the
door opened quickly and a servant's face appeared.
</P>

<P>
"Be good enough to ask Mr. Cavanagh to let me
see him for a moment, my name is Dagmar," I
said haughtily, "Sir William Dagmar," I added, for
the fellow seemed to hesitate.
</P>

<P>
He admitted me forthwith. "Mr. Cavanagh has
not long come in," he volunteered in sleepy tones.
"He is in the studio&mdash;step this way, if you please,
sir." He yawned in my face and turned about. I
followed him down a spacious dimly lighted hall,
furnished with almost regal magnificence in the
oriental style. He opened a door at the further
end, announced me in quiet tones between two
yawns and immediately withdrew. Sir William
Dagmar would not have put up with such a servant
for five minutes. Evidently, thought I, Mr. Cavanagh
is not a hard man to please. I entered the studio and
shut the door behind me; but to my astonishment,
I perceived Mr. Cavanagh, seated in a deep saddle-bag
chair beneath an immense arc glow lamp, fast
asleep. His chin was sunk upon his chest, his
arms hung at his side, and he was breathing stertorously.
I glanced about the room. It was rich
and commodious, but conventional. Priceless silks
and satins covered the walls. Rugs and skins from
all parts of the world bestrewed the polished parquet
floor. A large crimson curtained easel stood
upon a daïs of carven oak beside Mr. Cavanagh's
chair, and in a far corner glimmered an ebony
framed grand piano. Beyond a few pieces of rather
fine statuary, a prodigious chesterfield, and half a
dozen antique throne-shaped chairs, the place contained
no other furniture of note. I had expected
something out of the common rather than rich, and
I felt keenly disappointed, for I had seen a dozen such
studios pictured in the monthly magazines and
fashionable periodicals. I marched straight up to
Mr. Cavanagh and placed a heavy hand upon his
shoulder. He opened his eyes and looked up at
me in a dazed questioning fashion, but having
grasped the situation as it was apparent to him, he
sprang to his feet with a cry of consternation.
</P>

<P>
"Dagmar!" he gasped. "You&mdash;you&mdash;you!"
His voice trailed off in an ascending inflection into
a whisper of what I considered terrified amazement.
</P>

<P>
I pointed to the chair he had just quitted, "Sit
down!" I commanded sternly.
</P>

<P>
He obeyed limply; his eyes were dilated, fixed and
staring. It was plain that he stood in real fear of
me. I determined grimly to discover why.
</P>

<P>
Standing before him I folded my arms, and bending
my brows together I surveyed him, as I had
seen Irving in some of his heavy parts confront a
character he was destined by his playwright to
subdue.
</P>

<P>
This for two full minutes in a silence like that of
the tomb. The wretched man began to shake and
shiver.
</P>

<P>
"For God's sake, Dagmar," he stammered at
last. His voice was as hoarse as a raven's croak.
</P>

<P>
"Cavanagh!" said I, "what are you intending
to do with the money given you by the dice to-night?"
</P>

<P>
To my astonishment he covered his face with his
hands and his body began to heave with sobs.
Without stirring a muscle I waited for his explanation.
I divined that to be my cue. He grew
calmer by degrees, and at length with a sheer muscular
effort he forced himself to look at me. He
shivered as he met my eyes and groaned aloud.
</P>

<P>
"Woman!" I muttered cuttingly.
</P>

<P>
"You&mdash;hard devil!" he hissed with sudden
passion. He started forward, and our glances contended
for a moment, but his quailed before mine.
</P>

<P>
"Answer me," I commanded.
</P>

<P>
He bit his lips until the blood appeared, and he
gripped the sides of his chair with all his energy.
</P>

<P>
"Answer me," I repeated.
</P>

<P>
Of a sudden he began to cough. He coughed so
violently that the convulsions racked his frame, and
at length he sank back in his chair half-fainting,
with half closed eyes.
</P>

<P>
I waited pitiless as fate. "Answer me," I repeated.
"Must I wait for ever?"
</P>

<P>
But the fight had gone out of him. He heaved
a sigh, and two salt tears trickled down his cheeks.
"You know," he muttered, in a low, heartbroken
wail. "You know&mdash;you know!"
</P>

<P>
"Answer me," I thundered. Sir William Dagmar
might have known, you see, but I was
ignorant.
</P>

<P>
"I am going to give it to her&mdash;to her," he murmured;
his eyes were now quite closed and he seemed
upon the verge of a collapse. This would never
do!
</P>

<P>
I strode forward and shook him roughly by the
shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"To whom?" I hissed.
</P>

<P>
"To Marion, Marion Le Mar." He sat up and
looked dazedly around. "Oh, do what you please,"
he cried wildly, as he met my eyes. "What do I
care&mdash;I have not long to live in any case. A few
months more or less, what does it matter? And
she&mdash;God help her, she needs it&mdash;needs it as well
you know&mdash;you hard, inhuman devil!"
</P>

<P>
"You are mad!" I hissed. "What claim has
that woman upon you?"
</P>

<P>
"The woman I love?" He sprang to his feet
and faced me with just such a look as a tiger might
defend his mate. "The woman I should have
married, but for the accursed laws of the society
which you enticed me into joining!"
</P>

<P>
"You are a consumptive, a death's head!" I
sneered. "A nice man you to marry any woman!
Fool that you are, ask yourself would she have
married you?"
</P>

<P>
He gave me a look of almost sublime contempt.
"She loves me!" he said, and there was in his bearing
a dignity so proudly self-conscious, yet compassionate,
that my heart went out to the man; I
began to pity him profoundly, ay, and wish to help
him. I could hardly understand myself. I had
never felt like that for any living creature prior to
that instant. But I had work to do, pressing
work, and I put my feelings resolutely aside.
</P>

<P>
"George Cavanagh," said I, "you reproach me
with having bound you to a society whose laws
forbid your marrying the woman you love. But
it seems to me you aspire to break another of its
laws in giving her this money. What of that?"
</P>

<P>
"Fear nothing," he replied in tones of ice. "I
shall pay the penalty. When next the society
foregathers at your house, Fulton will announce
your numbers lessened by one death."
</P>

<P>
In spite of myself I started. Aha! thought I&mdash;I
grow hot upon the track.
</P>

<P>
"You will kill yourself?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
He bowed his head, and sat down again. He
had once more fallen to trembling. A curious man
this, a mixture of strength and weakness. He was
past redemption, wedded to the grave by his disease,
and yet he shivered at the thought of death. And
yet again, he could deliberately resolve to shorten his
life.
</P>

<P>
I frowned down at him. "Cavanagh," said I,
"I wish you to be good enough to repeat to me,
word for word, the rule you dare to dream of breaking."
</P>

<P>
"Useless!" he retorted. "I have well considered
it. For God's sake leave me, Dagmar, I
am done and desperate. I believe you mean me
well, but you are killing me."
</P>

<P>
I saw indeed that he was desperate, and straight
away I changed my tactics.
</P>

<P>
"George," I murmured in a soft and winning
voice, "I have come here to-night to save you if I
can, not to break you. Listen to me&mdash;it has been
well said that no rule or law was ever yet devised
by human ingenuity which might not be evaded by a
criminal with brains enough. You seek to be a
criminal. Well, well!" I nodded my head mysteriously.
"It is a pity&mdash;but I like you, boy&mdash;I don't
want you to die just yet. There may be a way
out, in spite of all. Now&mdash;trust me and obey
me."
</P>

<P>
A curious pang altogether strange to my experience
shot through my breast, as I watched the glow
of hope that flashed into the poor fellow's eyes, and
the colour flame into his ashen cheeks.
</P>

<P>
"Dagmar!" he gasped, "Dagmar!" and he
stretched out his shaking hands as a child might do.
</P>

<P>
"Repeat it word for word!" I commanded.
"Come, calm yourself&mdash;that is better; now!"
</P>

<P>
He could hardly articulate at first, but he grew
calmer as he proceeded.
</P>

<P>
"Whosoever shall win!" he began, "shall win
the proceeds of one completed month's joint contributions,
shall&mdash;during&mdash;the succeeding month,
apply the gold so gifted him by hazard of the dice
unto the&mdash;the&mdash;purpose that&mdash;that is&mdash;is provided
for by rule three. Should he, on the contrary, apply
it&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;Ah! you know, Dagmar, you know."
</P>

<P>
"Ay!" said I, "I know what follows&mdash;it spells
suicide in brief. But, my dear George&mdash;there is
hope for you in rule three."
</P>

<P>
"Impossible!" he gasped. "Impossible!"
</P>

<P>
I smiled. "There is no such word in my vocabulary,"
I answered firmly. "Now, George, give
me all your mind, every atom of your attention,
and I shall show you a path from your dilemma&mdash;an
honourable expedient. Repeat rule three!"
</P>

<P>
He knitted his brows together, and a curiously
strained introspective look came into his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"You are trying me!" he muttered. "Dagmar&mdash;if
you dared&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Fool!" I interrupted hoarsely&mdash;for my suspense
was painfully intense. "What object could
I serve? Do as I bid you! Do as I bid you!" I
pressed his hands more tightly, and with all my
strength I strove to subordinate his will to mine.
I succeeded.
</P>

<P>
"I'll trust you!" he muttered in a tense trembling
whisper. "I'll trust you, Dagmar. God
forgive you if you play me false!"
</P>

<P>
There was something so infectious in his emotion
that I felt myself tremble too, and involuntarily I
followed the terrified suspicious glances that he
darted about the room.
</P>

<P>
"Amen!" I cried. "Now Cavanagh&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But he uttered an exclamation. "Oh! You
are hurting me!" he cried.
</P>

<P>
In my excitement I had forgotten the man's
womanish physique, and I had cruelly crushed his
hands. Upon such trifling incidents does an ironical
malicious fate love to hang tremendous issues!
I do not remember if I have previously mentioned
the fact that the thumb of Sir William Dagmar's
right hand lacks a joint. But such is the case.
He had lost it through a gunshot when a lad. Now
this circumstance constituted the one flaw in my
disguise, for my hands are perfect. In the earlier
part of the interview I had been careful to conceal
them from view, but startled by Cavanagh's cry of
pain and words of reproach I did an unpardonably
foolish thing. I permitted myself, for one second,
to be victimized by a human impulse. Forgetting
everything except that I had hurt him and was
sorry, I opened my hands&mdash;and looked down at his
delicate crumpled fingers from which my brutal
grasp had driven all the blood. On the instant I
realized my own fatuity and attempted to repair
my error. It was, however, too late.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Cavanagh staggered back a pace. At first he
looked dazed, almost stunned, but his face turned
livid as I watched it and his eyes filled with flame.
They swept over me with glances that scorched,
that wished intemperately to harm, to avenge&mdash;to
kill! Finally they met my eyes, and for a long
moment we gazed into each other's souls. His
was full of rage, despair and terror&mdash;mine of savage
self-contempt and baffled hope, and fiery but impotent
regret.
</P>

<P>
"Who are you?" he hissed. "Curse you&mdash;who
are you?"
</P>

<P>
Desperate diseases require desperate remedies.
Already there floated before my eyes visions of
police, of handcuffs, courthouses and gaols. I saw
myself a prisoner serving sentence for criminal
impersonation. A shudder of horror shot through
my frame. Then came a blessed inspiration. "Mr.
Cavanagh belongs to a society&mdash;" cried my thoughts&mdash;"which
must have a criminal foundation, since
its laws dare impose such a penalty as suicide for
their infraction." I set my teeth together with a
grim snap and hoarsely retorted to his question.
"You wish to know who I am, sir. Well, I shall
answer you in part. I am a detective from Scotland
Yard!"
</P>

<P>
The effect of my announcement was completely
terrible.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Cavanagh threw up his hands, and with a deep
groaning gasp sank limp and insensible to the
floor. His face was so ghastly that I thought him
dead. I sprang to his side, and kneeling down
pressed my ear to his breast. I could not hear his
heart beat. With a moan of agony I stood erect.
I was shaking like a man in an ague&mdash;and for the
first time in my life fear took hold of me, sharp,
senseless fear. My mastering wish was to escape
quickly and without being seen. Darting to the
door, I waited but to open it without sound, and
then hurried through the hall, thanking Providence
in my heart that I still wore my felt-soled shoes.
No one hindered, no one saw me. In another
second I was out of the house, and seated in my
waiting hansom.
</P>

<P>
"Marble Arch!" I muttered to the driver, "and
quickly man, quickly, if you wish to earn a double
fare!"
</P>

<P>
When I reached the Marble Arch I was still panic-stricken
and incapable of coherent thought. I do
not wish it to be supposed that I am in any sense
a craven. But this was the first great crisis of my
career, and, like certain brave soldiers I have read of
who had fled from the field during their first battle
at the first fire, I was governed by an overwhelming
blind impulse impossible to withstand immediately.
I believe now that my excited imagination
convinced me that I stood in peril of being caught
and hanged for murder. At any rate, it seemed
terribly necessary to hide myself, and adopt every
conceivable expedient to shake all possible pursuers
off my trail. Running down Oxford Street,
I hailed the first cab I met and drove to London
Bridge. There I took another hansom and doubled
back to Piccadilly Circus. A third took me to
Tottenham Court Road. A clock chimed two
as I stepped upon the footpath. I was a good deal
calmer then, although still in a wreck of jangling
nerves. But I found that I could both control my
thoughts and think. I set off at once at a brisk
walk towards Holborn, growing more tranquil at
every step. I racked my brain for a plan of action.
I felt that I must get out of England at once and
start life anew in some foreign land. Fear, you see,
was still my tyrant. But how to effect my purpose?
I had only three pounds in the world, for the cabs
had run away with a sovereign. Bitterly I cursed
my folly and the panic which had prevented me
from rifling Mr. Cavanagh's pockets. They would
have yielded me a golden harvest I doubted not!
Of a sudden, as I strode along, I caught sight of my
reflection in a tailor's window. I stopped short,
shocked&mdash;horrified. I was still Sir William Dagmar
to the life! For two minutes I stood there paralyzed
in body and mind, then came a second inspiration.
I swung on my heel and glanced about me. The
street was almost deserted, but a belated hansom
was approaching. I hailed the driver. "200 Harley
Street," I cried and sprang inside. I had given
the fellow Sir Charles Venner's address. In a very
few minutes I was ringing at Sir Charles Venner's
bell. After a long wait and three successive summons,
the physician himself attired in an eiderdown
dressing gown and slippers opened the door.
</P>

<P>
"What, Dagmar!" he cried, in great astonishment.
"Come in. Whatever is the matter?"
</P>

<P>
"A call of private urgency!" I replied. "The
fact is, Venner, you can do me a favour, if you will.
A very dear friend of mine must get away from
England before morning on a matter of life and
death, and he needs more money in cash than I
have by me in the house. If you'll be so good as to
let me have three hundred pounds immediately, I
shall post you a cheque within the next hour."
</P>

<P>
We were standing confronting each other in the
hall beneath a low turned swinging gas jet. He
raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
</P>

<P>
"Will three hundred do?" he asked.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, thank you!"
</P>

<P>
"Then excuse me for a moment."
</P>

<P>
I waited in breathless suspense, but he returned
almost immediately, carrying a bag of gold and
notes from which he counted three hundred pounds
into my hand&mdash;you may be sure&mdash;into my left hand.
I kept my right behind me.
</P>

<P>
I curtly thanked him, begged him to excuse me,
and hastily withdrew. But he stood at the door
and watched me enter the cab.
</P>

<P>
I was therefore obliged to give the cabby Sir
William Dagmar's address. "Back to Curzon
Street!" I called out. As soon as we had turned the
first corner, however, I redirected the driver to Victoria
Station, and during the journey I set to work
to alter my appearance as much as lay in my power.
I tore off my false eyebrows, and with my kerchief
I vigorously rubbed the paint from my cheeks and
brow. A mirror set in an angle of the hansom
showed me, by the light of a match, a blotchy nondescript
face that nevertheless could not be mistaken
for my master's. Better satisfied, I began to reflect
on my position, and to my intense gratification I
found that I was no longer the slave of fear. Arrived
at the station, I discharged the cab and made
inquiries for the trains to the south. I found that
I should have to wait a great while. I therefore
selected a dark corner and gave myself up to thought.
In ten minutes I was wondering what on earth I
had ever been afraid of&mdash;and calling myself moreover
by very nasty names. Even if Mr. Cavanagh were
dead, and I began to doubt if my perturbed examination
of his body had given me the truth, who
could accuse me of his death? Again, if he lived,
he would infallibly, on his recovery, still believe me a
detective. He had not remotely guessed at my
identity. Oh! the fool I had been! But what
next? Were I to fly to France, I should give myself
away! My master would search my room
and discover my make-up box and various disguises.
Were I to stay it would probably never enter his
mind to suspect me! Ai! Ai! With patience,
boldness, and a little luck, I might even yet convert
the defeat I had sustained that night into a triumph.
I felt the blood bound in my veins. Waiting for
no more I sprang to my feet and hurried from the
station. Ten minutes later I noiselessly inserted
my latch-key into Sir William Dagmar's door, and
gently as any burglar stepped into the house. The
place was profoundly still. I hung up my master's
coat and hat in the hall and crept upstairs. At
Sir William's bedroom door I stopped, and stooping
pressed my ear to the key-hole. I distinctly heard him
breathing. He was a heavy sleeper, and his respirations
were deep and somewhat laboured. I passed
on with a smile of purest joy. Upon my dressing
table stood my make-up box and a profusion of
wigs, beards and moustaches. The sight gave me
pause. "It is wise to be bold!" I thought, "but
not rash. Here is danger. When Mr. Cavanagh
recovers and informs Sir William of to-night's
happenings&mdash;Ah!&mdash;and when, moreover, Sir Charles
Venner discovers that he has been swindled! What
then? It is unlikely, but at the same time just
possible that my master's thoughts may turn to
me!"
</P>

<P>
I caught up the wigs and stuffed them into the
box which I locked. Where to hide it? Not in my
room, nor in the pantry! nor in any place under my
control! Search would reveal it there&mdash;infallibly.
I must then dispose it in some place not likely to
be searched. Where then? For a third time in one
evening I was suddenly inspired. Seizing the box, I
stole downstairs into my master's private study and,
using the utmost caution, I bestowed it behind
some mounds of books that were covered with many
summers' dust. Heaving a deep sigh of relief
and satisfaction I returned to my little chamber and
leisurely undressed. Three o'clock chimed as I pulled
off my boots. I then removed the last traces of
my disguise with a lavish application of soap and
water, and last of all I screwed back into its plate
the tooth I had removed from my false set earlier in
the evening in order more perfectly to resemble my
master. After that I got into bed. I felt secure
and almost happy&mdash;was I not a capitalist? Under
my pillow reposed three hundred pounds, and
never in my life until then had I possessed more
than a paltry fraction of that sum. I rejoiced in
determining to bank it on the morrow, and I sleepily
assured myself that I would make it the seed of a
great fortune. I should have been quite happy,
save for one thing. I was already beginning to
repent the magnanimity or cowardice which had
prevented me from asking Sir William Venner for
six hundred pounds instead of three. I felt sure he
would have given me six as readily as three, and it
was a great opportunity wasted. Wasted! It is
terribly sad to look back upon wasted opportunities;
a heartrending thing indeed. Even now I recall
that circumstance with melancholy. I dreamed of
death and murders and shadowy unutterable horrors.
Soon after dawn I awoke, bathed in perspiration,
and shivering in every limb. There was a sound
of rushing waters in my ears, and I retained a shuddersome
impression of a dark brooding figure bending
over me. With a gasp of terror I plunged my
hand beneath my pillow, but my three hundred
pounds were safe. The delight of that discovery
quickly dispelled the phantoms of my tired fancies,
and I arose, with a glad heart, to begin the work of
the day, by performing the work that I should have
done on the previous night&mdash;the clearing up from
the dinner party.

THE KINGSMERE HOSPITAL FOR CONSUMPTIVES
</H4>

<P>
I prepared a particularly tasty breakfast that
morning for my master, and I took special pains
to please him as I assisted him to dress. He was not
a man given to paying compliments, but when he
entered the dining-room, and was unable to discover
a single trace of last night's feast, he did not dissemble
his surprise.
</P>

<P>
"You have re-established order very quickly&mdash;here
at all events," he remarked, "Butts always
took a day or two to clear up."
</P>

<P>
"That is not my way," I softly replied. "I could
not sleep until I had cleared up everything. If you
take the trouble to visit my pantry, sir, I will challenge
you to find a stain on floor or wall, or a single
speck on plate or cutlery."
</P>

<P>
"You appear to know your business," he conceded.
</P>

<P>
"From A to Z, sir," I answered. "Let me persuade
you to try this omelette, Sir William. I cooked it
myself."
</P>

<P>
A talent for making omelettes is one of the
few accomplishments I had acquired from my father.
</P>

<P>
My master nodded, and helped himself to a dainty
little roll. He tasted it, and actually smacked his
lips.
</P>

<P>
"Excellent!" he observed. "Brown, I hope
that Butts will not return, for his own sake. I wish
you to take charge of my household henceforth from
to-day. Your salary will be eight pounds a month."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir," I murmured gratefully. "I
shall do my best to please you, sir."
</P>

<P>
The street bell rang as I spoke. I slipped out, and
opened the front door. Mr. George Cavanagh
waited upon the steps, and on either side of him stood
Sir Charles Venner and Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
Well was it then that over my features I can exercise
an admirable control, for at sight of that trio
my heart felt like lead, and I shivered in my shoes.
</P>

<P>
"We must see Sir William Dagmar at once!"
said Mr. Cavanagh. "Our business is of the utmost
importance."
</P>

<P>
I bowed and invited him to enter. "Sir William
is at breakfast, gentlemen," I muttered as I closed
the door. "I shall warn him of your presence at
once. In the meanwhile will you kindly step into
this ante-room."
</P>

<P>
"No!" replied Sir Charles. "We shall go
directly to him. Don't be alarmed, Brown, we are
sufficiently intimate with Sir William to take such a
liberty."
</P>

<P>
I shrugged my shoulders, and deferentially preceded
them. Their faces were paste coloured and
preternaturally solemn. I was, however, glad to see
Mr. Cavanagh; I liked him, and it was a relief to be
sure that he was still alive.
</P>

<P>
Tapping softly at the dining-room door, I opened
it and entered, but I had no occasion to utter a word,
for the others had trooped in on my heels.
</P>

<P>
"Excuse this intrusion, Dagmar," began Sir
Charles in the French tongue, "you may believe me
when I tell you that nothing could have induced me
so to invade you except necessity."
</P>

<P>
My master leaned back in his chair, his mouth
agape with astonishment. "Necessity!" he repeated.
"What the deuce has happened?"
</P>

<P>
"Nothing less than a calamity. But first dismiss
your servant&mdash;we must run no risks, the matter is
too serious."
</P>

<P>
"Brown," said my master in English, "kindly
leave the room. I shall ring when I require you."
</P>

<P>
I bowed and obeyed. I would have cheerfully
given my three hundred pounds for an opportunity
of listening unseen to their conversation. But my
fate was in the balance, and I dared not play the spy.
Making a virtue of necessity I retired to the pantry,
and tried to eat. But in truth I had no appetite.
My nerves were on the jump. I lighted a cigarette,
and consumed it in half a dozen puffs. I chewed
another to pulp, but smoked the third. The sixth
restored me to calm. I felt myself again, and began
to polish the glassware. I postured my indifference
to myself and experienced an itch to whistle, just
to show myself how brave I was. Needless to say,
however, I suppressed the inclination. An hour
passed so, and then the library bell smartly tingled.
So they had left the dining-room. I hurried upstairs,
smoothing my expression as I ran. My master
met me at the door&mdash;a letter in his hand. "I
wish you to go out at once, and post this at the nearest
post-office&mdash;not in a letter box," he commanded.
"It is an important missive."
</P>

<P>
"Certainly, sir!" I replied, and took the letter.
He looked at me very keenly. His face was expressionless,
but it bore traces of recent agitation.
"I shall hurry back," I said.
</P>

<P>
"Not in a letter box!" he repeated. "Remember,
Brown."
</P>

<P>
I bowed deeply and departed. In half a minute I
was out of the house, but not until I had turned the
corner did I so much as glance at the "important
missive." It was directed to Mr. John Brown, Box
89, G.P.O. The envelope was of thin foreign parchment.
I held it up to the sun and smiled. It contained
a single sheet of blank paper. My message
then was a ruse to withdraw me from the house while
they searched my room. I felt so confident, however,
that they would never discover my make-up box,
that I smiled again, and to save myself the bother of
walking, I took a cab. After posting the letter, I
entered the first bank I came to, and requested the
manager to allow me to make a deposit. He wished
a reference, and I was bold enough to refer him to
my master. I then paid into the credit of Agar
Hume £290, and left the office. Two minutes later,
I returned and paid in nine pounds. I thus procured
two deposit slips. The one for £290 I tore in very
small pieces, which I scattered far and wide; I was
not afraid that the bank would swindle me. But
the other I treasured carefully. I walked home
very leisurely, and I found my master alone in his
study. He was pacing the floor, with an abstracted
air, his hands clasped tightly behind his back.
</P>

<P>
"I posted the letter, sir!" I announced.
</P>

<P>
He stopped in his walk and frowningly regarded
me. "Very good, Brown," he replied. "By the
way, my man, I want you to be very careful in admitting
visitors here again. I don't refer to the
three gentlemen who came this morning, they are
friends of mine. But strangers."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Above all, Brown, permit no one, stranger or
otherwise, to question you concerning me. If any one
attempts to do such a thing, inform me at
once!"
</P>

<P>
"Certainly, sir."
</P>

<P>
"That will do, you may go."
</P>

<P>
"I beg your pardon, sir," I muttered hesitatingly,
"I hope you will forgive me, sir, but the fact
is I have ventured to take a liberty with you this
morning, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Ah!" He started and looked at me with
piercing eyes.
</P>

<P>
"It's this way, sir," I said quickly, "I'm a saving
man, sir, and I've always wished to have an account
at a real bank, sir, not a post-office. Well, sir, I went
into a bank while I was out just now, but they
would not let me open an account without a reference.
So&mdash;so I dared to give them your name, sir.
I hope you'll excuse me, sir."
</P>

<P>
His eyes bored through me like a pair of gimlets.
"How much money have you saved?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Nine pounds, sir. Here is the ticket!" I
eagerly handed him the slip.
</P>

<P>
He glanced at it, and his face cleared immediately.
</P>

<P>
"That is all right, Brown!" he said, smiling
slightly. "If they apply to me, I shall try to satisfy
them that they have secured a worthy client. Good
luck to you, my man, I am glad to know you are
thrifty."
</P>

<P>
It is a curious thing how tenacious of life one's
conscience is. My master looked at me so kindly,
that I felt a perfect brute for having so mercilessly
deceived him, and I vow that for one fateful
moment I was on the point of voicing my compunction.
</P>

<P>
"You are t&mdash;too kind, sir," I began. "I&mdash;I'm
afraid I&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But he cut me short with a frown. "That will do,
my man," he interrupted in harsh tones. "I am
busy, and I wish to be alone."
</P>

<P>
Had he remained silent, or allowed me to proceed,
it is just possible that these memories might never
have had occasion to be written. As it was, I hastily
backed out of the room, and my conscience yielded
up its final spark in the passage.
</P>

<P>
Anxious to verify my suspicion, I proceeded to my
bed-room. It appeared, at first glance, exactly as I
had left it, but I am not a casual observer. The
door of my wardrobe stood slightly ajar. I had
latched it. My ready made evening suit was still
lying neatly folded in its drawer, but the waistcoat
occupied a different position from that to which I
had formerly assigned it. Finally the napped edge
of my counterpane was tucked beneath the bed-tick.
I had left it hanging, so as to curtain the iron rail. I
noted these trifling discrepancies with all the pride
of an explorer who has discovered a new territory.
There is no experience more gratifying to one's
vanity than to have successfully penetrated and
prevised another man's intention. I began to believe
myself a prodigiously clever fellow, and even
yet I dare to boast with reason. I have no deep
learning, indeed, my knowledge of the sciences might
be scratched with a pin, but I have nevertheless not
permitted the talents God has given me to rust, and
there is one book with whose contents I am fairly
well acquainted, the book of life.
</P>

<P>
Immediately my master had gone out to lunch, I
repaired to his study, and repossessed myself of my
make-up box. This I carried to my bed-room, and
placed in the wardrobe. I did not, however, intend
to leave it there very long. I did not anticipate
another search party, it is true, but I thought it thoroughly
advisable to have clean hands at home. My
idea was (now that I had capital to work upon) to
secure a private room somewhere in the neighbourhood,
which I might use as a stronghold, and to which
I might repair whenever I should desire to disguise
myself. During the next few days I took frequent
excursions abroad in my leisure hours, and at last I
discovered exactly the place I wanted. It was on
the top floor of a bachelor apartment house in Bruton
Street. The chamber was small, but excellently
lighted, and it had this advantage, it was disconnected
by an angle of the building from its fellows;
moreover its door faced the stairs, and was not overlooked
by any other. On that very account, it had
long been untenanted, but me it suited perfectly.
After a good deal of haggling with the agent, I secured
it on lease for £25 a year, and by paying six
months' rent in advance, I persuaded him to dispense
with references. I furnished it only with things I
absolutely needed. A bed-chair, in case I might
ever be obliged to sleep there, an oil stove, a thick
rug for the floor, a fine three-fly-full-length mirror
set upon a revolving stand, a dressing-table, and a
large cabinet. I procured a locksmith to fit the door
with a practically impregnable latch lock, and with
the key upon my chain, I felt as proud as the most
bloated land-holder in Westminster. My next move
was to purchase a fresh supply of paints, wigs and
various other sartorial disguises including a number
of new and second-hand character costumes. I
have before remarked on the fact that every tooth
in my head is false. Now in all the paraphernalia
of disguises, there is nothing so important as the
item of teeth. Teeth give expression to both mouth
and voice. A difference of one twentieth fraction
of an inch in their length for instance, will alter the
voice beyond hope of recognition, even to a truly
practised ear, however fine its sense of perception.
As for the lips, they at once become drawn out, and
utterly transformed in shape. My last and most
tender care, therefore, was bestowed upon my teeth.
I visited a dozen different dentists, and procured
a dozen sets of varying shapes and sizes, whose only
point of resemblance was, that they fitted my mouth.
When all was done, my bank account was depleted
by a hundred and fifty pounds, but I felt that I had
acquired a first-rate stock-in-trade, and I did not
repent of the expenditure.
</P>

<P>
While I was busy with these arrangements, I by
no means neglected my master. For a week or two
after the disturbing visit paid by Sir Charles Venner,
Mr. Cavanagh, and Dr. Fulton, he remained in a
preoccupied and gloomy mood, and seemed unable
to settle down to work. I listened in my pantry
by the hour, to his footsteps restlessly pacing the
floor of his library above my head. He also went
out more frequently than was his custom, and remained
longer away from the house. He was irritable
and hard to please. However quietly I entered
any room where he was, he heard and anxiously confronted
me. He seemed constantly to expect an
unwelcome visitor. Sometimes he swore at me for
startling him, but he always apologised, and I saw
that he was beginning to like me well. I longed for
him to trust me, for I was burning with curiosity to
know what determination his society had arrived at,
regarding his daring impersonator. But that was
out of the question, and I was obliged to content
myself with guesses. Gradually his alarm passed off,
and he resumed his literary labours as of yore. That
pleased me, for I felt that his attitude might be relied
upon to reflect the feelings of his fellow conspirators.
I began to consider what further step I should
take in my campaign to elucidate the mystery surrounding
that strange brotherhood. After a great
deal of reflection, I resolved to shadow Sir William
on the next Sunday excursion, for I could not help
suspecting that his regular absences from home on
that day in each week had something to do with the
secret society to which he belonged. With that end
in view, on the following Saturday afternoon, I
begged my master to allow me a holiday until the
Monday morning, pleading by way of excuse a dear
friend's sudden illness. He graciously consented,
upon my promising to prepare his breakfast beforehand.
I left the house about nine o'clock, and repaired
to my little stronghold in Bruton Street,
where I spent the night. Always an early riser, I
arose at dawn, and made a hearty meal of the provisions
which I had brought with me. I occupied
the next few hours in selecting and perfecting a disguise.
On this head, I may here remark, that I have
never in my life committed a mistake of attempting
to assume a character representative of a class. Such
an undertaking requires too great a strain upon the
imagination, and however clever one may be, breeds
mischievous errors of detail and anachronisms, so to
say, which may readily be detected by a keen observer.
My method has always been to impersonate,
that is, to duplicate as closely as possible, some living
person, with whose habits and idiosyncrasies I am
familiar. On this occasion I chose for my model
an old actor with whom I had once upon a time
shared rooms in Birmingham. His name was
Francis Leigh. He was a tragedian of a bygone
generation, and he had many tricks and mannerisms
which I had delighted to imitate. When I had completed
my make-up, I am sure that had Francis and I
chanced to meet in the street, he would have believed
that he looked upon his own counterfeit presentment
in a mirror. I wore a frock suit of shabby genteel
respectability, a frayed topper, and well-worn shoes.
The original character of my mouth was altered by a
set of false teeth, much longer than those I ordinarily
made use of. Long iron-grey locks fell from my hat
rim, to my collar, my nose was attenuated by skilfully-painted
hollows, and a pair of heavily frowning false
eyebrows cast my eyes into a natural and also a senna-tinted
shade. I was quite ready by seven o'clock,
but I occupied the hour I had to spare in practising
gestures before the mirror. Perfectly satisfied at
last, I strolled to Curzon Street, and before many
minutes had elapsed I was gratified to perceive Sir
William Dagmar emerge from his house, and set off
at a brisk walk towards Park Lane. I followed him
at a reasonable distance, keeping all my faculties
alert. Entering Park Lane, he pursued his way
towards Marble Arch, without once looking behind
him. He was dressed in a sack suit of plain grey
tweed, he wore a soft felt slouch hat, and he carried
a stout walking stick, and a dark overcoat. Convinced
that he was not in the least mindful of my
existence, I gradually diminished the distance between
us, until I could distinctly hear his somewhat
laboured breathing. When almost at the corner
of Oxford Street, he paused suddenly, glanced about
him for a moment, as though he had forgotten where
he was, and then abruptly crossed the road to the
cab stand. He chose a hansom, and ordered the
driver to take him to Hampstead Heath by way of
Finchley Road and Frognal Rise. I waited until he
had disappeared, then followed in a second hansom,
which bore me leisurely in his wake. He alighted
and dismissed his cab at the gates of the Heath. I
did likewise. I had watched him enter the Heath,
and proceed in the direction of Jack Straw's Castle,
as my vehicle toiled up the hill. For a while I lost
sight of him, but hurrying through the gates, I was
just in time as I came to White Stone Pond, to perceive
him enter the inn. He emerged as I approached,
wiping his lips with his handkerchief.
Evidently he had partaken of refreshments. Without
wasting a glance at me, he turned down Heath
Brow, and set off in a north-westerly direction, towards
Heath House and Hendon. He descended
the hill slowly, as though already fatigued, and often
he rested in a musing fashion, looking steadily before
him for a minute at a time. I lingered at a great
distance, confident of overtaking him when I wished.
It was a glorious morning, and the green sparkling
Heath was dotted with still and moving figures of
men and women, taking advantage of the sunshine,
in which I was revelling. Sir William Dagmar
looked, however, neither to right nor left. Either
he was too bitter-minded to notice and rejoice in the
beauties of the landscape, or he had some pressing
business to perform, which absorbed his attention.
Crossing the valley he began to climb an opposing
slope, and at length entered a long straggling thicket.
From where I stood, I could see three different paths
emerging from the thicket's further side, and as the
country thereabouts was rugged and broken up with
rocks and trees, I waited for some time in order to
discover which path he might choose, lest I should
lose him. Ten minutes went by, however, and he did
not appear. At the end of another five, I began to
fear that he had given me the slip. Hurrying down
the hill, I crossed the slowly rising vale and cautiously
approached the thicket, by the route that my
master had taken. It was less dense than it appeared
at a distance, but in places it was thick enough
for a man to hide in. A hundred paces brought me
to the edge of a small, clear patch of fresh green-sward,
furnished with a couple of rustic benches, set
fairly close together. Upon the further bench, my
master was seated, his face set towards me, in earnest
converse with a woman. I almost cried aloud in my
surprise. Indeed, I must have in some fashion exclaimed,
for he raised his eyes and surveyed me with
an intolerant annoyed expression, as though to inform
me that I intruded. On instant I pretended
to be the worse for liquor. Shambling forward, I
sank down upon the first bench, stretched out my
feet before me, and permitted my hands to fall limply
by my sides. For three or four minutes a dead
silence reigned. Conscious of their examination, I
kept my face set straight, and frowning heavily. I
heard at length the mutter of exchanged whispers,
and fearing to drive them away, I began to act.
Flinging out my right hand with a fiercely tragic
gesture, I declaimed in a hoarse voice, broken with
hiccoughs, portions of Hamlet's immortal soliloquy.
This gave me opportunity for an occasional glance
at my quarry. Sir William was very pale, and he
looked weary. His companion was watching me,
but her face was veiled. Her figure was lithe, and
beautifully shaped, and she was richly dressed. I
knew she must be young. Of a sudden I resolved
upon a bold stroke. I rose up, and ceasing to declaim,
staggered towards them. "Friends!" I
cried, "in me you behold a wreck of former greatness,
a shattered hulk, cast by unkind fate on a lee
shore of fortune. Gaze on this battered form, this
shrunken frame, these gaunt and famished limbs,
and t&mdash;r&mdash;r&mdash;emble when I tell you that time was,
when in happier hours, a shouting populace
acclaimed their owner's frame immortal!" I paused,
and swaying from side to side the while, I drew from
my pocket a tattered kerchief. "Sic transit gloria
mundi&mdash;Good friends," I wailed, "kind friends, if
you have tears prepare to shed them now, for by'r
Lady do I swear to ye that nor bite nor sup has
passed these parched and fever-smitten lips these
four and twenty hours!"
</P>

<P>
I put up my kerchief to my eyes, and sobbed
aloud; but my hard-hearted auditors preserved a
stony silence.
</P>

<P>
Without uncovering my face, I stretched out my
left hand. "Charity, friends, charity!" I muttered
brokenly.
</P>

<P>
"No, Marion," said my master's voice. "Cannot
you see that the rogue is tipsy?"
</P>

<P>
"True, but a small gift may induce him to depart."
The woman's tones were of dulcet softness,
but the accent was distinctly foreign.
</P>

<P>
"Charity!" I hiccoughed, "Charity!"
</P>

<P>
"Be off with you, you rascal!" cried my master
sharply. I clutched a shilling, and broke into a
stream of drunken sobbing thanks. Moving off I
collided designedly with the vacant bench, and
sprawled upon the ground. There I lay pretending
to be senseless. They came up, and turned me over
on my back; Sir William Dagmar also kicked my ribs,
but I answered all attempts to revive me with snores.
</P>

<P>
Satisfied apparently with my condition, they
presently returned to their seats and began to converse.
The crown of my head was presented to
their gaze, so I could not see them, but I could hear,
and not a word escaped me. "I thought for a moment
he was really hurt," said the woman.
</P>

<P>
"He is half stunned and wholly asleep," replied my
master, "nevertheless let us speak in French. We
cannot be too careful, Marion."
</P>

<P>
"Would it not be as well to move on?" asked
the woman.
</P>

<P>
"For you perhaps, my child. You are young and
strong, but I am old, and my stroll has tired me out.
Let us rest yet a little!"
</P>

<P>
"As you please, M'sieur."
</P>

<P>
"You were describing the effects of the picra
toxic solution," suggested my master.
</P>

<P>
"That is true. Alas! M'sieur, we have once more
a failure to record&mdash;so many failures!" she replied
drearily. "The operation is always so perfect, so
perfect, and yet always the patients die,&mdash;of
shock!"
</P>

<P>
"Ah! Then the woman is dead."
</P>

<P>
"There will be a funeral to-morrow, M'sieur.
The failure is complete. Sir Charles is sad. He does
not speak, but he shuts his mouth, so!"
</P>

<P>
"And Fulton?"
</P>

<P>
"From the first he had no hope, M'sieur. He
declared the drug a poison, a neurotic intoxicant&mdash;malignant,
deadly. He smiles&mdash;so&mdash;like a dog, and
shrugs his shoulders. But he too said little!"
</P>

<P>
"What next Marion?" asked my master in a
hoarse hollow voice.
</P>

<P>
"God knows, M'sieur. Soon we shall have exhausted
the pharmacopoeia. Providence is very
cruel to us, very cruel. We have been vouchsafed
one half of the secrets of life, and it seems to me that
in seeking the remainder we expand our energies in
vain. Meanwhile the hands of us all become more
deeply dyed with blood! M'sieur, as God hears me,
I sometimes think myself a murderess."
</P>

<P>
"Hush, Marion!"
</P>

<P>
"No, M'sieur, I shall speak what is in my heart.
I cannot see these wretched creatures die, as day by
day they perish, without often asking myself the
question&mdash;are we justified? I have spoken to Sir
Charles and Dr. Fulton, but they freeze me with
their cold cold 'Science.' I swear to you, M'sieur,
that were it not for George, I would be tempted to
break my oath!"
</P>

<P>
"Foolish child, you must not trifle with this weakness.
Crush it, subdue it!"
</P>

<P>
"Ah! Bah! M'sieur. Bid the breeze cease blowing.
A woman's heart is weak!"
</P>

<P>
"But not the heart of a woman who loves, my
child. Remember, this is George's life for which
you are striving. And those others, what are they
but worthless ones, condemned already past redemption.
Granted perhaps that our experiments may
hasten the inevitable end. Of what do we deprive
them, but a few weeks or days of painful suffering.
Ah, no my child, you must not turn back now. Any
day the secret may be discovered, the door of life
thrown open to us all. And that to you will mean
the instant realizing of your dearest dreams. Think
of it, Marion, your lover yours to wed, yours for long
years of happiness."
</P>

<P>
The woman answered in a sobbing voice. "George
is so miserable, M'sieur."
</P>

<P>
"Does he yet know?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, and he speaks of death, he is filled with
despair!"
</P>

<P>
"You must be firm with him, my child. I have
discovered that he is in debt, deeply in debt. For
that reason he most despairs, because he fears to
leave you poor as well as desolate. I fear that he
contemplates some desperate expedition. But you
must persuade him to be patient. You know, Marion,
that we are all pledged not to assist each other financially.
On that account I dare not help your lover,
though I care for him as if he were my son. But
with you it is different."
</P>

<P>
"How, M'sieur?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, my dear&mdash;you are not of our order, being a
woman, although you are attached to us by ties
which may not be unravelled. Take this package,
child. It contains a great sum of money. Ten
thousand pounds. I shall not ask you to tell me
what you do with it. No child, not a word."
</P>

<P>
"M'sieur, M'sieur!" cried the woman.
</P>

<P>
I was so amazed, so confounded with astonishment,
that to have saved my life I could no longer
have kept still. I sat up, and turned my head. The
tableau is as clear to my remembrance now as though
it had happened yesterday. My master was gazing
at the woman, his companion, with a look of paternal
tenderness. His countenance was transfigured beyond
recognition, for in place of his half saturnine,
half querulous aspect, I saw an expression of such
holy and unselfish love, that in very wonder I caught
my breath. The woman with both hands held the
package he had given her, to her breast. Her bosom
heaved and fell with deep inarticulate emotion.
Moreover she had raised her veil. Never had I seen
a face one half so beautiful. Her eyes were large
and finely shaped, in colour a passionate red brown.
Her nose was straight, and cast in the Grecian mould,
with thin quivering curved nostrils. Her mouth a
perfect bow. The lips were tremulously parted.
I have since seen the expression they wore then,
perpetuated on the canvas of Botticelli's most famous
Madonna. It was indescribably pathetic, full
of both bliss and pain. Her face was pure oval, and
so delicately tinted was the skin, that I could have
fancied that I looked upon an inspired painting,
rather than a mere human woman. Fortunately
for me, neither had remarked my movement. As
soon as I perceived the indiscretion of which I had
been guilty, I turned about again, and bending my
forehead to my knees, I groaned aloud. The sound
broke the spell. I heard them mutter together, and
a moment later their departing footsteps. I waited
until all sound had died away, then rose hurriedly
to my feet, and cautiously pursued them. Shielded
by the trees, I watched them from the edge of the
grove take a north-westerly course, that seemed destined
to lead them to a point between Child's Hill
and Hendon. I followed in a diagonal direction,
taking advantage of every obstacle in the landscape
to conceal myself from view, for the woman frequently
looked back. Quitting the Heath at length,
they entered a hedge-fenced road, full of twists and
turns, which helped my purpose famously. At the
angle of each curve, I waited until they had turned
the next, and so on. Soon, however, they abandoned
the main road, in favour of a devious maze of lanes.
At last I lost them; lingering over long at one bend,
when I reached the next they had disappeared.
They had been moving so slowly, that I knew very
well that they must have entered some house. I
retraced my steps, and searched the lane, which had
evidently swallowed them up. Only one house had a
frontage to that spot. It was a large grey stone edifice,
set back about a quarter mile from the road.
The grounds were encompassed with a high stone
wall, and planted thickly with beeches, chestnuts,
and elm trees. I nodded and approached the gates,
which stood wide open. Upon one of the posts
was fastened a small brass plate, inscribed with the
following legend:&mdash;"Kingsmere Hospital for Consumptives."
I closed one eye slowly, and nodded
again. As well as if Sir William Dagmar had informed
me, I knew that before me lay the key to the
mystery, which it was my self-constituted task to
solve. In order to make assurance doubly sure, I
passed through the gates, and with the cautious
cunning of an Indian, I approached the house. The
path was wide and gravelled, but somewhat overgrown
with weeds. It often bifurcated to surround
a grove of shrubs, or shade trees. The whole garden
wore a rank, uncared-for look. The plantations
were thick with undergrowth. In certain beds the
unpruned rose-bushes had become giants, and had
grown into thickets, while in others grasses choked all
memory of cultivation. The place was in fact a wilderness.
The cover was so excellent, that I was able
to insinuate myself within twenty paces of the building,
without risk of discovery. Striking aside from
the road at that point, I sneaked into a grove of
laurels, that commanded a view of two sides of the
house. There I cast myself down upon the ground,
and although perfectly defended from the keenest
observation myself, by peering through the weeds
and tree trunks, I could watch both path and house,
as well as any spy could wish to do. The building
was three storied, but of no great size. Its front was
ornamented with a doric porch; otherwise it was
plain, square, and unpretentious. I judged it to contain
a dozen large rooms at most. Its windows were
all shut, and covered with impenetrable green blinds,
though the lattices stood open, perhaps for purposes
of sanitation. At the rear I could see a line of straggling
stone, slate roofed sheds, which seemed to have
been recently erected, for their cemented walls had
a fresh, unweathered look. I wondered what they
contained, for they were too large and numerous to
be assigned as stores for ordinary domestic uses.
"Morgues perhaps!" I thought, and shuddered.
"By chance the dead patient, of whom the woman
and my master had conversed, was even now lying
in one of them!"
</P>

<P>
The idea gave me the creeps, for I have a horror of
death. I tried to forget the sheds, and resolutely
watched the house. A soundless hour went by, and
I was feeling hungry, but I did not think of departing.
My Waterbury told me it was half-past two
o'clock. At three, I began to wonder at the silence
of the place. At four, I was suspecting the place to
be deserted. The shadows were lengthening to the
day's close, and I was chewing my handkerchief to
assuage my famished appetite when of a sudden I
heard a curious noise. It was hoarse, guttural,
chattering, and it seemed to issue from the sheds,
which I had fancied to be morgues. I listened with
every sense on strain. The noise increased, and
subsided at intervals, sometimes it became a perfect
babel, and harsh animal-like cries quivered through
the din. My curiosity became a plague, but I no
longer doubted that the place was tenanted, and I
dared not explore. The queer sounds I have attempted
to describe, lasted about twenty minutes,
and then all was still again. I did not know what
to think. Were wild animals confined in those
sheds? I was still wondering when I heard footfalls
on the gravel path, rapidly approaching the house
from the lane. A moment later I saw Sir William
Venner striding through the twilight. His face was
quite expressionless. He marched up to the porch,
and disappeared. As I heard neither knock nor
sound of bell, I concluded that he had entered with
a latch-key. More than ever determined to remain,
I fought my appetite as best I could for the next
three hours. By then it was quite dark, and the
glow of lamps appeared through the green blinds,
covering the windows of the house. Feeling
wretchedly stiff and cramped, and cold to my bones,
I stood up and rubbed my limbs. When the circulation
was restored, I crept out of the covert,
where I had lain so long and stealthily approached
the line of sheds. Their back walls were of blank
stone, and showed me nothing; moreover, although
of different size and height, all were attached together,
and also to the house. I skirted the rear,
and turned the corner. Still no window, but before
me stretched an asphalted court-yard. Peering
round the second corner, I saw into the hospital's
kitchen, through the open back door. It was lighted
up, and a comfortable fire burned in a large stove,
before which stood a covered spit. A wrinkled old
woman sat before a table kneading some pastry with
her fingers. An old, grey-bearded man sat in a distant
corner, his knees crossed, his arms folded. He
was smoking a pipe, and the light glistened on his
bald pate. It made rather a pretty picture, that
kitchen, with its Darby and Joan interior. I considered
it a while, and then glanced along the face
of the mysterious sheds, only once more to be baffled.
It consisted of a blank wall, pierced only with an
occasional padlocked door.
</P>

<P>
Thoroughly disgusted I returned to the front of
the house, and took up a position hard by the trunk
of a fine old elm tree, that grew at the first branch
of the path. There I waited for another hour, but
at last my patience was rewarded. The door suddenly
opened, a man came out, and approached me
with a quick firm tread. It was too dark to see his
face, but I guessed him to be Sir Charles Venner.
He passed me so closely, that by stretching out my
hand I could have brushed his cloak. He had not
taken another ten steps, however, before the house
door was again thrown open, and another man
issued at a run. "Venner!" he shouted, "Venner!"
</P>

<P>
The voice was Dr. Fulton's.
</P>

<P>
"What is it?" demanded Sir Charles, from behind
me, coming to an abrupt halt.
</P>

<P>
"One moment, Venner, where are you?"
</P>

<P>
"Here!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner returned towards the house,
and the two men met at the very angle of the path,
within six feet of my nose. I hugged the tree-trunk,
and waited, hardly daring to breathe.
</P>

<P>
"Could you strain a point, Venner, and operate
to-morrow night?" asked Dr. Fulton in a pleading
voice.
</P>

<P>
"No, old chap, I can't. You know my rule.
I must give myself three days between each, for the
sake of my nerve."
</P>

<P>
"Just for once!"
</P>

<P>
"Impossible, Fulton. I wonder that you ask me.
I have myself to consider as well as the cause. We
may succeed or we may not. But I am hanged if I
deliberately risk destroying my own health for anything
or anyone. I consider that I do quite enough
for the cause as it is."
</P>

<P>
"You do, Venner, you do; but just for once do
oblige Marion. She begged me to ask you. You
see, the fact is, Cavanagh is cranky."
</P>

<P>
"Damn Cavanagh!"
</P>

<P>
"With all my heart, but then you see, there is
Marion. What should we do without her?"
</P>

<P>
"That is all very well. But what should we do
without me!"
</P>

<P>
"The poor girl is half out of her mind worrying
about Cavanagh. He has not even had the grace to
come here all day, though he promised."
</P>

<P>
"He is an infernal young cad!"
</P>

<P>
"I think so too, but it does not mend matters.
The girl is crazily in love with him, and she thinks
he will kill himself, if we can't do something for him
soon."
</P>

<P>
"Puppy!" The tone was bitterly contemptuous.
Sir Charles seemed to hesitate. "Look here, Fulton,"
he proceeded, "I am sorry for Marion, of
course; nevertheless, I cannot help her. Tell her I
am out of sorts, or make any other excuse you like.
I shall not operate until Tuesday evening. Good-night
to you!"
</P>

<P>
"One second, Venner, She begged me, if you
refused her first request, to ask leave for Cavanagh
to be present at the operation. You'll have no
objection to that I suppose!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh! curse the fellow," exclaimed Sir Charles
very irritably. "He becomes the bane of my existence.
If we admit him to the room, we are bound to
have a scene. He will either faint or do something
equally idiotic. You know very well that the least
interruption may play the devil with my knife."
</P>

<P>
"She has pledged his good behaviour, Venner.
Besides, I'll promise to look after him. Come, come,
old chap, don't send me back to her quite empty-handed."
</P>

<P>
"The consequences must be upon your own head
then."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, Venner, you are a good fellow!
Good-night!"
</P>

<P>
"I am, on the contrary, a soft-hearted fool. Good-night!"
</P>

<P>
They parted, and I heaved a sigh of relief.
</P>

<P>
When the silence had resumed itself, I stole
through the plantation to the gate, whence, after
carefully fixing the locale of the hospital in my mind,
I made a speedy return to civilization, and an hour
later I was discussing a hearty meal in a private
room at Jack Straw's Castle.

THE OPERATION
</H4>

<P>
Tuesday arrived before I knew quite what to
do. On that particular morning the postman
handed me, amongst a sheaf of bills and circulars,
a letter sealed with a peculiar signet, addressed
like the others to my master. As it wanted an hour
to Sir William's waking time, I had plenty of leisure
to investigate its contents. It puzzles me how any
people can be foolish enough to imagine that a mere
dab of wax, however cunningly impressed, can confer
security upon their correspondence. In two
minutes the seal was lying safe and uninjured upon
my pantry table, and the detached envelope rested
confidingly across the mouth of a bowl of boiling
water. The letter ran as follows: "My dear Dagmar,&mdash;Whoever
the rascal really is who imposed
upon Cavanagh and myself on a recent memorable
evening, he lied in declaring himself an emissary of
the police. I have just succeeded in establishing
this fact, and take the earliest opportunity of reassuring
you, while allowing detailed explanations
to await until we meet. I have no longer any doubt
but that our adversary is a blackmailer, and I feel
sure that before long one or other of us will be
approached. I sincerely trust that the fellow will
turn out, as you suspected, to be your scapegrace
nephew. In that case you, of course, must deal
with him, but in any other event I am convinced
that our best course will be to prosecute. This will
notify you that I intend to propose such a resolution
at our next conclave.&mdash;Yours sincerely, <SPAN CLASS="scap">Charles
Venner</SPAN>.
</P>

<P>
"P.S.&mdash;If you can, see Cavanagh to-day. I have
been weak enough to permit him to witness the
operation. It is possible that you may dissuade
him.&mdash;C.V."
</P>

<P>
I carefully resealed the letter, and pressed the
envelope with a heated flat-iron in order to remove
all traces of my manipulations. All the time I was
in a whirl of thought. For three days I had been
wondering how I might get a footing inside the
hospital and witness the operation which Mr.
Cavanagh had extorted a privilege to see. After
reading Sir Charles Venner's letter I was more
anxious than ever to do so, but the more determined
I became the less hopeful seemed my prospects. If
Mr. Cavanagh had been a bigger man I believe I
should have resorted to some desperate expedient
to get him out of the way, so that I might take his
place. Unhappily for me, however, he lacked full
two inches of my stature, and I dared not attempt
to impersonate him under the brilliant light which
must necessarily pervade a surgeon's operating-room.
I solved the problem that was troubling me,
while preparing my master's breakfast, and when I
proceeded to his room and handed him his letters, I
knew exactly what to do. Sir William Dagmar had
a scapegrace nephew&mdash;well, his scapegraceship
should be my scapegoat. It is true that part of
Dr. Venner's letter put the idea into my mind. I
do not pretend to pose as a superhumanly clever
person, but I am not without talent, and my genius
is in my power to twist every accident to my own
advantage.
</P>

<P>
It was my master's custom to dispose of his correspondence
while I prepared his bath after awaking
him. As I re-entered his bed-chamber to announce his
bath ready, I found him standing before the fireplace
in his dressing-gown, watching the transmutation of
Sir Charles Venner's missive into ashes in the grate.
</P>

<P>
"Your pardon, sir," I murmured softly. "About
a fortnight ago you commanded me to immediately
inform you if any stranger should venture to question
me concerning your affairs."
</P>

<P>
He swung round on the instant and faced me, his
lids narrowed over his eyes, and his lips compressed
in a hard straight line.
</P>

<P>
"Well!" he grated. "Well!"
</P>

<P>
"This morning, sir, about two hours ago, a man
came here and asked to see you&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"His name?" he interrupted harshly.
</P>

<P>
"He would not give his name, sir, and for that
reason I took the liberty of refusing to admit him."
</P>

<P>
"You did well, Brown. What had he to say?"
</P>

<P>
"He left a message for you, sir. He asked me
to tell you that Mr. Sefton Dagmar wished you to
meet him alone on the railway station at Newhaven,
at nine o'clock to-night precisely." Butts had told
me that Sefton Dagmar lived at Newhaven. One of
my greatest natural endowments is an almost perfect
memory.

My master's eyes glistened and his cheeks flushed.
"Oh, indeed!" he muttered. "Anything else,
Brown?"
</P>

<P>
"Y&mdash;yes, sir!" I lowered my eyes and tried to
look abashed. "I&mdash;I&mdash;scarcely like to tell you,
sir," I stammered; "the messenger was&mdash;most&mdash;im&mdash;most
impertinent, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Never mind, Brown; tell me exactly what he
said."
</P>

<P>
"He declared, sir, that if you did not keep the
appointment, you'd have leisure to repent your
foolishness in gaol!"
</P>

<P>
"What!" he thundered, and threatened me with
his clenched hands. His face went purple, then pale
as death, but his eyes glowed like coals.
</P>

<P>
"I'm sure I beg your pardon, sir," I muttered,
stepping back quickly and affecting to be terrified.
"You&mdash;you made me tell you, sir."
</P>

<P>
With a great and manifest effort my master recovered
his composure. He even contrived to smile.
"I&mdash;I&mdash;you must forgive me, Brown," he muttered.
"I&mdash;I could not for a moment conceive that&mdash;that
my nephew would dare to send me such a message.
Mr. Sefton Dagmar is my nephew, Brown, and I am
sorry to say that&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
I raised my hand and quickly interrupted him.
"Please, don't say any more, sir," I cried in tones
of deep respect. "I am your servant, sir, and I
hope I know my place. When you know me better,
sir, you will find that I am not one of the prying sort,
who is always trying to hear more than he should.
It's likely that in your anger now you'd be telling
me something that you'd afterwards regret, and if
you'll forgive me for speaking plainly, sir, I like you
too much, and I'm too happy in your service to
want to risk losing your confidence and my place
together! Such a thing has happened to me before,
sir, and without my seeking either."
</P>

<P>
Sir William Dagmar was the most surprised looking
man in the world at that moment. He seemed
to have forgotten everything, but the enigma before
him, and he stared at me as if he wished to read
into my soul.
</P>

<P>
"Have you no curiosity?" he demanded at
last.
</P>

<P>
"None that I can't control, sir," I replied respectfully.
</P>

<P>
"Well, I'll be damned!" he muttered. "You
are either a superlatively finished hypocrite or a
philosopher of sorts. Which is it, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
I looked into his eyes and sighed. "It's as you
please, sir, and I won't pretend not to understand
you," I answered mournfully. "But if I did act
the hypocrite a bit in anticipating the occasion to
speak as I did just now, where's the harm, sir?
You are a rich gentleman, Sir William, and you have
no idea of what a cursed thing it is for a poor fellow
like me to go about looking for employment, and
eating up my little bit of savings, sir. Last time I
was out of a place it cost me six pounds for board,
not to speak of the agent's fee; and I have
been hoping that I was settled here for life,
sir."
</P>

<P>
"You may yet be, if you choose, Brown. I am
perfectly satisfied with you; and, upon my soul, I
believe you are reliable."
</P>

<P>
"Just so, sir; but you won't continue to believe
that long if you trust me with more than a servant
should be trusted. It's not in human nature,
sir!"
</P>

<P>
"You mule!" he cried with a gesture of impatience.
"But have your way, have your way!
Now return to the subject. What more have you
to tell me?"
</P>

<P>
"Very little, sir, except that the man tried to
pump me, but I gave him not a whit of satisfaction.
Oh, I beg pardon, sir. The postman came up while
he was talking. I'd have shut the door on him
before, only I saw the postman coming."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes."
</P>

<P>
"Well, sir, the man saw that letter, and he offered
me five pounds for it&mdash;cash down, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Ah! What reply did you give him?"
</P>

<P>
"I shut the door in his face, sir."
</P>

<P>
My master nodded. "What sort of a man did
he appear to you, Brown. Not exactly a gentleman,
I suppose?"
</P>

<P>
"No, indeed, sir. A low creature and poorly
dressed. I was ashamed for the postman to catch
us talking, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Would you recognize him again?"
</P>

<P>
"Among a thousand; he had a scar across his
left cheek and half his left ear gone, sir."
</P>

<P>
My master nodded, and, turning, walked thoughtfully
into the adjoining bath-room. We did not
converse upon the matter again, but all that day
the poison I had instilled into his mind was working,
working. I perceived its effects when he returned
to the house somewhat late in the afternoon, doubtless
after having paid a visit to Mr. Cavanagh, for
he did not go abroad during the forenoon. He
looked worried and distrait as I admitted him, and
passing me without a word, he went straight up to
his bedroom. Ten minutes later his bell rang. I
hurried up to find him standing in the hall, clad for
the street, a heavy fur-lined overcoat across his arm
and a bag in one hand.
</P>

<P>
"I'll not be home until to-morrow morning," he
said curtly, "so you need not wait up for me,
Brown; but, please, on no account leave the house."
</P>

<P>
"Very good, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Above all, admit no caller. You understand?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir. Shall I call a cab for you, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"No." He pointed to the door, I opened it, and
he went out. A cab was waiting for him beside the
pavement. The clock struck five as I shut the door.
At six o'clock I entered my little stronghold in
Bruton Street. At eight I descended the stairs, in
all things my master's double. In all things I declare
advisedly, for warned by experience I wore
upon the thumb of my left hand just such a little
finger-stall of violet velvet as Sir William Dagmar
used in order to conceal his deformity whenever he
went abroad. This was secured around my wrist
with an elastic band, and I took the precaution to
stiffen its interior with a thin ferrule, so that no
involuntary working of the thumb joint might betray
me. For precaution's sake I carried a revolver,
mastering by an effort of will my natural repugnance
for such gruesome implements. I proceeded to the
Heath by three different hansoms, and a fourth
conveyed me to my point of destination, a secluded
little tree sheltered spot at an angle of a lane about
a hundred yards from the gate of the Kingsmere
Hospital for Consumptives. There I alighted, and
bidding the driver to await me, I hurried towards
the hospital. The gate upon the occasion of my
first visit stood open; now it was shut, but latched,
not locked. I passed through and sought the house.
It was my opinion, from what I had observed, that
all welcome visitors to that building possessed
master keys to the front door, and were accustomed
to enter unceremoniously. Unwilling to attract
unnecessary attention to myself, since I had no
latch-key, I decided upon a rear attack. I therefore
passed down the side of the house and, flanking
the sheds, approached the kitchen door. It was
shut, the window blinds were closely drawn, but a
light gleamed through the crevices. I rapped gently
on the panels once, twice, thrice, at short intervals.
Upon the third summons I heard the sound of
cautiously drawn bolts, and the door opened about
four inches on a chain. A wrinkled grey-bearded
face peered out at me. "<i>Qui va là?</i> Who is dare?"
demanded a cracked voice, its foreign accent in the
English fairly rasping the evidently unfamiliar
words.
</P>

<P>
"It is I, my friend, Sir William Dagmar," I
replied very softly in French.
</P>

<P>
The old man immediately released the chain and
threw the door wide.
</P>

<P>
"Enter, Monsieur," he said politely.
</P>

<P>
I did not require a second invitation, but before
attending to me the old man refastened the door.
He then turned and looked at me inquiringly. His
expression was a curious combination of cunning
and intelligence. I saw at once that he was astonished
at the manner of my coming, and that he
considered that he was entitled to an explanation.
"I wish to see Mademoiselle Le Mar, privately and
quickly," I muttered in his ear.
</P>

<P>
"But, Monsieur," he began.
</P>

<P>
I took a sovereign from my pocket and allowed
him to perceive it. He stopped dead in his speech
and a greedy look came into his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Contrive to let her know that I am here," I said
quietly.
</P>

<P>
He nodded and hobbled out of the kitchen, making
so little noise, however, in his exit that I guessed he
wore rubber-soled boots. Mine were shod with felt.
My object in sending for Marion Le Mar was to
obtain a guide over the house, a very important
desideratum, since I had never been inside its walls
until that moment. I was kept waiting about ten
minutes, when the old fellow suddenly reappeared.
</P>

<P>
"Monsieur! She comes," he muttered, and
stretched out a skinny paw for the money.
</P>

<P>
I let it drop into his hand, and turned at a sound
to behold standing in the open doorway the woman
I had seen in my master's company last Sunday on
the Heath. I had thought her beautiful on that
occasion, although her head and all the upper portion
of her face were hidden with a veil. Now I caught
my breath, and for an instant dreamed I looked
upon a spirit from some other world. Her forehead
was broad and low; her head, exquisitely shaped,
was covered with a glory of gleaming gold which
admirably contrasted with the dark and level pencilling
of her brows, and the russet flashing of her
wonderful red-brown eyes. The one weak spot in
my composition is that I am the slave of female
beauty wherever found, and yet until that moment
I had been wise enough to worship the sex collectively.
But standing in the doorway I recognized
my fate, and I bowed my head before her.
</P>

<P>
She advanced and offered me her hand. Only
then I perceived that she wore a uniform, a nurse's
uniform; but that stiff apparel which makes most
women appear unlovely could not deny the expression
of her charms.
</P>

<P>
"Monsieur," she whispered, "you sent for me."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, my child," I answered in still lower tones.
I pressed her hand, then let it fall, though I grieved
to release it. "Where is Cavanagh?"
</P>

<P>
"Upstairs in the operating room with Dr. Fulton.
I must be quick, for they are almost ready to begin.
Sir Charles has just arrived."
</P>

<P>
"Ah! so Cavanagh still persists. I had hoped
to find it otherwise."
</P>

<P>
"Alas! Monsieur. I have begged him to go, but
he had determined to see all."
</P>

<P>
"In that case, for your sake, my child, I shall
bear him company."
</P>

<P>
"What&mdash;you!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Marion! You have work to do, and he
may need my care!"
</P>

<P>
She gazed at me a moment with a look of passionate
gratitude, then of a sudden, stooping low,
she caught and kissed my hand. It tingled for days
afterwards.
</P>

<P>
"Heaven bless you, Monsieur!" she cried, her
whole face radiant. "Come, then, and we shall go
to them. Sir Charles will be enchanted, for he hates
that George should be present, since we have no
one to spare who might attend him if the poor boy
should feel ill or swoon. If that should happen,
Monsieur, you will take him away at once; is it
not so?"
</P>

<P>
"Immediately, my child."
</P>

<P>
It seemed that there no longer existed any reason
why we should converse in whispers, and we did not.
Indeed, my beautiful conductress filled the journey
with gay chatter and musical ripples of laughter.
Evidently, thought I, she must love Cavanagh
already to distraction, when the small courtesy I
have proposed can inspire her with such happy
spirits. Absurd as it may appear, I began to feel
jealous of Cavanagh already, although Marion had
never seen me in my proper person, and was no
doubt unaware of my existence. She led me down
a spacious hall carpeted with oil cloth, and up a
staircase that was not carpeted at all, to the floor
above. We passed down a corridor and stopped at
the third closed door, from beneath which exuded
a long narrow bar of brilliant white light. Her
manner while ascending the stairs had gradually
calmed, but she was still excited, and she opened
the door with a burst of informing words pouring
from her lips. Never shall I forget that moment.
I glanced in with a face that I flatter myself was
expressionless to the perfection of indifference, and
I took care to make my lip curl in Sir William Dagmar's
characteristic aspect of querulous cynicism.
But in truth my every sense was awake and poignantly
acquisitive. The apartment was large, full
thirty feet square. It contained two operating
benches placed within easy distance. The upper
slab of one was absent; upon the other lay a squat,
bulky figure, strapped into position and covered
with a sheet. Above each table depended from the
ceiling a perfect swarm of incandescent lamps, each
furnished with a powerful reflector which caught
and cast the rays of light upon the bench beneath.
Tables stood about the walls of the room, at regular
intervals, covered with all manner of basins, batteries,
knives, forceps, scissors, and other surgical
instruments. There was no other furniture except
a solitary chair perched near the door, upon which
Mr. Cavanagh was seated. Sir Charles Venner and
Dr. Fulton, clad in clean white aprons and overalls,
with their sleeves rolled up and secured with bands
above their bare elbows, stood beside one of the
tables steeping some ugly looking knives in a basin
of steaming fluid. At the end of the occupied
operating bench stood two full blood African negroes.
Their appearance was not remarkable, and in the
glance I flashed upon them I could discover no
point in which they differed from any other negroes
I had seen, except that like the surgeons they were
both attired in white. Mr. Cavanagh got to his
feet as we entered. His countenance was pale and
tense. I perceived that he was nervous, but he had
evidently wound himself up to the highest pitch of
determination of which his nature was capable, and
I thought it probable, whatever the others expected,
that he would comport himself like a man. Marion
addressed her announcement to the surgeons, but
her eyes were bent upon her lover, and to him in
truth she spoke. She lauded what she called my
devotion to the skies, and to my surprise the others
appeared to accept me at her valuation.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner nodded commendingly. Dr.
Fulton said, "It is confoundedly good of you,
Dagmar," and Mr. Cavanagh gave me a look of
earnest gratitude.
</P>

<P>
I dismissed the subject with a shoulder shrug, and
asked Dr. Fulton to assign me a position. He
directed me to stand near Cavanagh until all was
ready. I obeyed, and for a space of some minutes
I watched Marion, who flitted about the place
arranging certain instruments upon the several
tables, and wringing dripping sponges dry with
antiseptic towels.
</P>

<P>
When Sir Charles had completed his preparations,
he turned to the nearest negro. "Beudant," he
said, "you may light the asbestos." He spoke in
French.
</P>

<P>
The fellow bowed and hurried to the fireplace. I
saw a great flame rise, which flushed the negro's
glistening forehead with a crimson glow.
</P>

<P>
"Jussieu," said Sir Charles, "it is time!"
</P>

<P>
The second negro bowed and glided from the
room, followed by Dr. Fulton. Sir Charles dipped
his hands into a basin of fluid offered him by Marion,
and wiped his fingers with a towel. Two minutes
later a bell tinkled, "Beudant," said the surgeon.
</P>

<P>
The negro bowed again like a slave to a lamp, and
noiselessly departed. Very soon I heard the dull
tramp of slippered feet on the corridor without.
The door opened, and the negroes re-entered the
room bearing between them a long slab, on which
rested the inert figure of a young man. He seemed
about twenty-two years of age. His face was extremely
pale. His eyes were closed and his mouth
was propped wide open with a curious spring wedge.
He was nude to the waist, but thence downwards
wrapped in an eiderdown shawl. His chest was
narrow and his body hideously emaciated. As his
chest moved up and down under his deep laboured
breathing the ribs projected horribly, leaving dark
hollows between. He was strapped securely to the
slab and in such a thorough fashion that he could
scarcely have moved a muscle howsoever much he
had been minded. But he was evidently unconscious,
doubtless in an anaesthetised sleep. This
curious procession was followed by Dr. Fulton and
a tall elderly gentleman similarly apparelled to the
surgeons. I had never set eyes on him before. He
had an eager, enthusiastic face. His nose was very
long; he had high cheek-bones and prominent grey
eyes full of a strange fanatical light. I put him
down at one glance as a devotee of science. Afterwards
I discovered that his name was Vernet, that
he was a Frenchman, and resident house-surgeon to
the hospital, which in fact he owned.
</P>

<P>
He was the last to enter, and he closed and locked
the door behind him. The negroes advanced to the
bench, and having deposited the slab with its senseless
burden, they moved over to the other operating
table. Already the room had become oppressively
hot, and I noticed beads of perspiration stand out
on Sir Charles Venner's forehead as he bent to
examine his patient with a stethoscope. Dr. Fulton
beckoned Cavanagh and myself to approach, and by
signs he directed us to stand at the feet of the young
man upon whom Sir Charles was about to operate.
We were thus quite out of the way of those who had
work to do, but we could see everything, and I desired
no better vantage post. Dr. Fulton stood
behind the patient's head at the other end of the
slab, holding in one hand a large rubber face mask,
in the other a large stoppered phial, connected by a
tube with the mask. Sir Charles Venner stood
beside the patient between the two operating
benches; and beside him was Dr. Vernet. Marion
faced them from across the patient's body. She
held in one hand a sponge, in the other a basin.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner lost no time in proceeding to
business, nor did he give us the least warning of his
intention. Casting his stethoscope aside, he seized
a small thin-bladed knife and applied its edge with
a free sweeping stroke, as an accomplished artist
might draw a freehand with a pencil, diagonally
across the patient's third and fourth ribs, within an
inch of the breast bone. A thin streak of blood
followed the cut as quickly as thunder follows
lightning. Marion instantly applied her sponge to
the wound, and the red line disappeared. The
surgeon, without pausing, made another swift incision
at right angles to the first along the third rib,
and followed this with a third, parallel to the first,
some six inches apart. Marion pursued his cuts
with her sponge, dipping it each time into her basin,
which doubtless contained some powerful astringent
drug, for the wounds once touched ceased to bleed.
Sir Charles Venner made some further rapid cuts,
and with inimitable dexterity he presently raised
the flap of flesh and muscle so detached by his knife
from the patient's ribs, back across the chest, and
secured it there with a dart attached by a string to
a bandage passed about the subject's loins. With
the speed of magic he applied half a dozen tiny silver
spring clips to the dripping flesh, in order to secure
the ruptured blood vessels. Dr. Vernet then handed
him a tiny razor bladed saw, with which, to my
horror, he immediately attacked the bared heaving
ribs. The ghastly sight sickened me so much that
I closed my eyes, and for some minutes I fought like
a tiger with the weakness that threatened to undo
me. The world was rocking, rocking, ay, and beginning
to swing. I should in the end probably
have fainted, but that my companion, Mr. Cavanagh,
observing my condition of a sudden pressed his
handkerchief to my nostrils. I inhaled an intoxicating,
subtle, but most powerful reviving essence.
Afterwards I learned that Marion had supplied him
with several capsules of nitrate of amyl, of which he
had himself already consumed more than one. I
felt the blood rush to my head and swell out my
cheeks and scalp and skin. The effect was magical.
My weakness passed like a black dream, and with
restored courage I opened my eyes. There was now
a gaping cavity in the patient's breast, through
which I could see at work the mysterious machinery
of life. The inner flap of the exposed lung had been
uplifted and secured aside with a ligature. Below
panted and pulsed a crimson and purple-coloured
shapeless thing. It fascinated and at the same time
terrified me. With a frightful effort I tore my eyes
away and looked at Sir Charles. He was screwing a
sharp-edged, curved hollow tube to the end of a
long and curiously fashioned syringe. This syringe
was furnished here and there with golden taps and
tubes and tiny force pumps. One tube stretched
beyond the operator and ran to the other operating
table. I followed it with my eyes and saw that it
terminated in a long, thick, hollow needle which
reposed in the hands of the negro Beudant. The
other negro, Jussieu, knife in hand, bent over an
object lying on the slab before him&mdash;the squat,
bulky figure which had excited my curiosity upon
my entering the chamber, and which then had been
covered with a sheet. But the sheet had now
vanished, and before and exposed to my view lay
an enormous ape, a chimpanzee I fancy, which was
strapped to the bench exactly in the same fashion
and attitude as Sir Charles Venner's patient. The
ape's huge hairy breast was disfigured with a square,
bloody opening, but I saw that he was alive, for he
breathed. The negro Jussieu had evidently performed
an operation on all fours with that executed
by Sir Charles Venner! The idea almost stunned
me. Jussieu was then a great surgeon, although a
negro. Next instant I considered the ape, and a
panic horror almost overwhelmed me. George
Cavanagh was again my saviour. There came a
sound of rushing waters to my ears, and the room
began to whirl and sway. On the very threshold
of oblivion once again the thin and penetrating
flavour of the nitrate of amyl restored to me my
faculties. I buried my teeth in my lower lip and
cursed myself for a pitiful poltroon. I looked up
to meet Marion's eyes. She smiled at me so tender
an encouragement that I turned cold with shame;
that she, a delicate woman, could bear unmoved a
sight that stole my manhood, fired my heart with
more of rage than wonder, though I wondered too.
I fiercely resolved not to be weak again.
</P>

<P>
Until that moment the silence had been absolute,
but of a sudden Sir Charles spoke. "Wait for the
systole, Vernet!"
</P>

<P>
I glanced down and saw Dr. Vernet insert his
right hand into the hole in the patient's breast.
He was armed with a large, cup-shaped clasp. He
fumbled for a moment, and then, nodding his head,
he withdrew his hand.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles threw Cavanagh a quick scornful
glance. "Attend, if you wish to understand," he
commanded. "I'll try to be explicit!"
</P>

<P>
I looked for the first time at Cavanagh. He held
a kerchief tightly to his face, but his eyes, which I
alone could see, were simply lurid.
</P>

<P>
"Go on!" he muttered in a muffled voice.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles inserted the edged tube attached to
the syringe with both hands into the patient's breast.
</P>

<P>
"This is the right ventricle," he began, speaking
in quick, disjointed sentences. "Its function is to
force the venous blood through the pulmonary veins
to the right auricle; thence to be distributed over
the body. I am now&mdash;about to&mdash;insert&mdash;a needle
into the right ventricle through the pericardium
and walls. How is the pulse, Fulton?"
</P>

<P>
"Right, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Are you ready, Beudant, Jussieu?"
</P>

<P>
"At the word, sir," replied the negroes.
</P>

<P>
"Good!" exclaimed Sir Charles. "I am too!"
He withdrew one hand from the ghastly cavity and
seized the syringe pump, which he began to compress.
"I am now forcing into our subject's right
ventricle the solution of my invention, which is
destined to slay the tubercle bacilli. In two seconds
the lungs will be suffused with the fluid, and in two
minutes we shall have worked the miracle of absolutely
destroying every bacillus contained therein.
But we shall also have killed the patient's blood.
See, it is already decomposing. Mark how white
the lung grows. To work, Jussieu!" he cried.
"To work!"
</P>

<P>
"Ready, sir!" cried back the negro. I could not
see what he did, but I saw the tube connecting Sir
Charles Venner's patient with the opposite table
suddenly rigidify as though a rod had been slipped
down its hollow interior.
</P>

<P>
"We are now correcting the solution's destructive
action on our subject's blood by forcing into his
heart a fresh supply of living arterial blood taken
from the left auricle of the ape lying yonder," explained
Sir Charles. "Vernet is meanwhile extracting
our subject's own decomposed and now
useless blood, which is really blood no longer, from
the greater artery in his right leg. You see, Cavanagh,
we have established a perfect system of drainage.
We are supplying good blood and removing bad."
</P>

<P>
"My God!" cried Cavanagh. "It is white!"
</P>

<P>
His exclamation referred to Dr. Vernet's work.
The French surgeon had made a deep incision in
the patient's right thigh, from which gushed a
steady fountain of yellow fluid.
</P>

<P>
"Shout when it colours, Vernet!" commanded
Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
I looked on, speechless with amazement, I had
no longer the least inclination to faint. Indeed, my
whole soul was so steeped in wonder, that I forgot
I lived. I was merely a rapt acquisitive spirit being
initiated into the fundamental mysteries of nature
by a great, indeed, a giant intellect. Sir Charles
Venner appeared to me then something like a god.
His left hand was plunged into the patient's breast,
perhaps grasping the heart, that seat of life. His
right compressed and controlled the movements of
the syringe. His face gleamed like marble in the
brilliant white light of the reflectors. It was pale,
composed, expressionless, yet full of watchful intelligence
and power. He stood upon his feet as
steady as a rock. Every moment he uttered some
sharp, pregnant direction to one or other of his
assistants, which was at once implicitly obeyed.
"No greater man has ever lived!" thought I then,
and I have not altered my opinion since.
</P>

<P>
In about three minutes, though the period seemed
longer to my electrified imagination, I saw a red
light flash into the milky fountain that flowed under
Dr. Vernet's guidance.
</P>

<P>
"Enough!" he cried.
</P>

<P>
"Good!" exclaimed Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
The fountain stopped flowing on instant, for Dr.
Vernet had squeezed the artery between a pair of
forceps, and with deft fingers he began to bind it
with a ligature of golden wire. I glanced from him
to Sir Charles. He was now bending closely above
the cavity in the subject's breast; the syringe had
disappeared. He seemed to be sewing something
in the hollow, but I could distinguish nothing for
blood. Marion's sponge plied backwards and forwards
with the regularity of a machine.
</P>

<P>
"What are you doing now?" cried a voice beside
me, so harsh and strained that I hardly recognized it.
</P>

<P>
"Sewing up the punctured ventricle," replied Sir
Charles with a sort of chuckle. "Some of your
friends would be a bit surprised, eh, Cavanagh, if
you told them that you saw a doctor patch a man's
heart with thread and needle, as a sempstress might
a rent gown!"
</P>

<P>
Cavanagh uttered a hollow groan, and I turned
just in time to catch him. He had swooned! I
carried him to the other end of the room, where I
laid him down upon the floor and hurriedly unfastened
his collar and cravat. I was hot with rage,
for I wished to witness the end of the operation;
but I dared not leave him because of Marion. Even
as I knelt to chafe his wrists, I heard Sir Charles
address her sharply: "Now then, Marion, attend
to me. The young fool is all right. Dagmar will
look after him."
</P>

<P>
I managed to awaken Cavanagh at last with a
capsule I found clutched in his hand, but several
precious minutes had been wasted, and we returned
to the table only in time to see Sir Charles sewing
up with golden wire the flap of muscle which had
been the door of his more important work.
</P>

<P>
The operation was over. The negroes were
already starting to remove the carcase of the dead
ape, whose life blood had been stolen to try and
prolong the existence of its fellow creature, man!
The other surgeons were grouped about the still
living subject, but Sir Charles Venner was no longer
in command. Dr. Fulton now held supreme
authority. He occupied Venner's former post, and
with one hand he fingered the subject's now unfastened
wrists, while in the other he grasped a
small hypodermic syringe. For some moments a
deathly hush obtained, that was but intensified by
the slow and stertorous breathing of the patient on
the slab.
</P>

<P>
Dr. Fulton's expression was strained and passionately
anxious. It formed a curious contrast to
Sir Charles Venner's stolid immobility. The others
watched him, not the patient. That is to say, all
but Marion. She had slipped an arm about George
Cavanagh, and she was tenderly supporting him,
oblivious of everything else.
</P>

<P>
"Well?" asked Sir Charles at last.
</P>

<P>
I gasped with relief to hear his voice.
</P>

<P>
"Weaker; curse it!" replied Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
"Inject?"
</P>

<P>
"No; last of all. The battery, quick, the glass
stool!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles and Dr. Vernet darted off. Sir Charles
returned with a glass bench, which he placed upon
the floor at Fulton's feet, and upon which Fulton
immediately stepped. Dr. Vernet stopped beside a
distant table and began to pull out something that
looked like a cylinder from the side of a huge wooden
box. We heard the rapidly intermittent clicking
sound of the working battery at once.
</P>

<P>
"Stop!" shouted Fulton.
</P>

<P>
I saw the patient's legs twitch and draw up half
way to his stomach, and his arms spasmodically jerk.
</P>

<P>
This was repeated a dozen times in as many
seconds, but gradually the motions ceased.
</P>

<P>
"Awaken him!" commanded Dr. Fulton.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles applied a small phial to the patient's
nostrils. After a while the poor fellow turned his
head aside as though unconsciously trying to escape
a torture. But the phial followed him remorselessly,
and presently he moaned. Sir Charles at once removed
the spring wedge from his mouth. His teeth
clicked, shut, and he uttered a heartrending gurgling
groan.
</P>

<P>
"More battery!" shouted Fulton. "Softly,
softly!"
</P>

<P>
The patient's muscles jerked again, but less
violently than before. He tossed and turned his
head, trying vainly to escape the phial; thus for a
moment, then of a sudden his eyes opened and he
gazed about him.
</P>

<P>
"Stop battery!" cried Dr. Fulton. "Marion,
come here!"
</P>

<P>
The girl left her lover and hurried forward. She
stooped over the patient and looked into his eyes.
"Ah, my poor fellow!" she murmured soothingly
in English, "you are awake at last, I see. It is all
over now&mdash;all over&mdash;nothing more to fear now.
Soon you will be well and strong. Stronger than
you have ever been in your life before&mdash;for you are
cured."
</P>

<P>
He looked up at her with a dull, vacant stare,
then uttered a little gasp of pain, for Dr. Fulton
had plunged the hypodermic needle in his arm.
</P>

<P>
The injection's effect was miraculous. Within
three minutes his face flushed crimson, his dull eyes
brightened, and he actually attempted to sit up.
Marion, however, gently pressed him back, but she
allowed his head to rest upon her arm.
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;feel fine!" he gasped.
</P>

<P>
"Hush!" said Marion; "you must not talk.
You must be very good and keep still, for that is
the only way you can get better."
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner pressed a glass into her hand.
</P>

<P>
"Try and drink this," she proceeded. "It is not
medicine, only a little brandy and water. Ah!
that's right. You'll do splendidly now. There, my
boy, shut your eyes, and try to sleep. You'll soon
sleep, and you'll wake well and strong."
</P>

<P>
The poor lad obeyed her, and he seemed to sleep
immediately, but Marion's prophecy was not fulfilled.
He never opened his eyes again.
</P>

<P>
For a long hour we watched him, the hearts of us
all racked with anxiety. Every few minutes Dr.
Fulton injected some drug into his arm, and by
degrees the full force of the battery was applied.
But all in vain.
</P>

<P>
"He is dead!" said Dr. Fulton at last, stepping
dejectedly from the glass stool. "Turn off the
battery, Vernet, please."
</P>

<P>
"Our nineteenth failure!" observed Sir Charles
Venner, folding his arms and looking down at the
corpse with a face of stone. "And they have all
died of shock. Nothing else."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Cavanagh started forward. "How can you
be sure of that?" he demanded. "How do you
know that your accursed solution did not poison
him?" The young man's face was the hue of
ivory, but his big eyes were ablaze with passion.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner gave a wintry smile. "We
have proved it beyond doubt," he replied. "We
have tested the blood a hundred times."
</P>

<P>
"Bah!" retorted Cavanagh with a savage sneer.
"A fig for your tests. But even if they are reliable,
how do you know that he did not bleed to death
from the wound you made in his heart?"
</P>

<P>
"Test again, autopsy. Would you care to see?
Look here!" He caught up a knife and approached
the corpse. "I'm willing, Cavanagh, to bet you a
thousand pounds that not one drop of blood has
passed my puncture in the ventricle!"
</P>

<P>
"Done!"
</P>

<P>
"Venner," cried Dr. Fulton, "Venner, you are
betting on a certainty."
</P>

<P>
"Then I'll pay the stake I win to any charity
you like to name." Sir Charles Venner bent over
the body, but even as he poised the knife to cut,
Mr. Cavanagh cried out in strangled tones: "Stop!
I&mdash;I withdraw."
</P>

<P>
Venner looked up with a cold sneering laugh.
"Then pay!" said he.
</P>

<P>
"No&mdash;no! I&mdash;I&mdash;can't afford it." Mr. Cavanagh
put his right hand into his breast pocket. His
countenance was perfectly livid. He stepped back
a pace and looked at Marion.
</P>

<P>
"George!" she cried, "what ails you, dear?"
She was trembling like a leaf in the wind.
</P>

<P>
"Life!" he answered, and uttered a laugh that
still echoes in my ears.
</P>

<P>
Next instant he produced a revolver and before
our eyes put the muzzle to his mouth. There followed
a click, a sharp report, and he fell at our feet
a corpse.
</P>

<P>
There are periods of crisis in human happenings
when a cycle of years may be compressed into a
few minutes of ordinary time, and such a period
was that which succeeded the tragedy I have described.
I felt my soul grow cold and hard and
more old than all my previous life had made it. I
stood like a frozen image gazing at the artist's clay,
waiting in an agony of expectation for Marion to
scream. But she made no cry, and after a long,
most dreadful pause, something impelled me to look
at her. She was swaying to a fall and already
insensible. I took her in my arms and bore her
senseless body from the awful room. At the door,
however, I was obliged to halt, for the threshold
was occupied with the two negroes and the wrinkled
old woman I had seen in the kitchen the first night
I had visited the hospital. They were transfixed
with horror, and I had to force a passage for my
burden. In doing so, involuntarily I turned. Dr.
Fulton was kneeling beside Mr. Cavanagh examining
his wound. Sir Charles Venner stood at a little
distance puffing calmly at a cigarette. I shuddered
and passed on. Where I would have gone, Providence
alone knows. But the old woman followed
me, crying out in a cracked voice in French: "But,
M'sieur, why not come this way, to Mademoiselle's
own room."
</P>

<P>
She led me to a prettily furnished little chamber
at the very end of the corridor. I laid Marion very
gently down upon the bed, and turned to the old
woman, who was already fussing at my side with
salts and sal volatile.
</P>

<P>
"Don't touch her!" I commanded sternly.
"Let her sleep as long as God wills. She will
awake too soon in any case to the misery this night
has brought her."
</P>

<P>
"As Monsieur pleases!" replied the beldame, and
with a look of ghoulish delight she hurried off, doubtless
to gloat over the corpses in the operating room.
</P>

<P>
Left alone, I leaned over the unconscious girl, and
softly pressed my lips upon her beautiful, but clay
cold brow. An angel could not have been the worse
for that caress, for in my heart there was no thought
save of pitiful and tender reverence.
</P>

<P>
A moment later I was traversing the passage, on
my way to the staircase. Someone called to me as
I passed the chamber of death, but I paid no heed,
and I descended the steps as quickly as I could.
The hall door stood before me. The latch yielded
to my touch. Issuing forth I banged it shut, and
ran out into the night as though I were pursued
with furies. On alighting from my cab at the Marble
Arch I glanced at my watch. To my astonishment
it pointed barely to midnight. I thought it must
have stopped, but the public-houses were still open.
</P>

<P>
A second cab took me to Bruton Street, whence
having changed my attire, I drove to my master's
house. As I entered I noted upon the floor at my
feet a paste-board visiting card, which had evidently
been slipped beneath the door by a disappointed
caller. I picked it up and held it to the light,
uttering, as I read, a long, low whistle of surprise.
It was inscribed with three printed words: "Mr.
Sefton Dagmar."
</P>

THE CAMPAIGN OPENS
</H4>

<P>
That paste-board gave me a shock; it sent a
chill, creepy feeling down my spine. It
smelt dangerous. I read the name again: "Mr.
Sefton Dagmar!" So, while my master was away
journeying down to Newhaven to keep the appointment,
I had fabricated, with his nephew; by a snarl
of chance, his nephew had called at his house in
London. Perhaps they had passed each other on
the road.
</P>

<P>
I turned over the card and received a second
shock. Across it was scrawled in pencil:&mdash;"Will
call to-morrow morning at 10. Urgent."
</P>

<P>
"Curse the luck!" I muttered. "Uncle and
nephew will meet and my master will learn that, in
spite of his injunction not to leave the house, I
disobeyed him. Subsequent discoveries will infallibly
re-excite his first and easily smothered
distrust of myself!" It seemed to be more than
ever important that the secret of the identity of my
master's impersonator should be preserved and
that not the remotest breath of suspicion should
attach to me. Otherwise it would be impossible
to improve my fortunes without assuming the
naked and hideous character of a blackmailer, the
very idea of which was bitterly repugnant to my
disposition. I hurried into Sir William Dagmar's
library, lit the gas and caught up a time-table. It
informed me that the first passenger train from
Newhaven would arrive in London on the following
morning at 10.15. I made a hasty calculation. It
would take Sir William fifteen minutes to drive
from the station, and the train might be a little late,
trains often are. If Mr. Sefton Dagmar therefore
might be relied on to be punctual, I should have at
least half an hour wherein to smoothe out the snarl
of fate arranged for my undoing. Much might be
done in half an hour! Relieved by the reflection,
I put out the light and went upstairs to bed. I was
very tired, but I cannot truthfully declare that I
slept. Whenever my eyes closed I saw horrid
visions. Mr. Cavanagh lying on the floor with his
skull shattered and blood oozing from the hole in
his head; or a white faced man stretched upon a
marble slab with a dreadful bloody cavity in his
chest; sometimes a hairy chested ape similarly
situated! God defend me from such another
night! At dawn I arose from my bed of torture
and lay for an hour in a plunge bath filled with hot
water. A subsequent ice cold shower and a careful
toilet restored to my appearance its pristine freshness,
but there were many grey hairs about my
temples which I had never seen before. I am not a
lover of wine, but I dared not face the day without
support, and I derived the stimulus I needed from a
bottle of my master's champagne. Afterwards I
felt better, but I also felt that I should never be able
to smile light-heartedly again. The hours that
followed I devoted to thoughts of Marion Le Mar.
I admitted to myself that I loved her, and deep
down in my heart I knew that for her sake and at her
bidding I would sacrifice, if need arose, anything,
even my life. It was a strange conviction that, to
be entertained by a man like me&mdash;a man whose
motto had ever been&mdash;"First person paramount."
And yet I speedily recognized that it was as much a
part of me as my hand, and might only as easily be
combated or parted with. I had no hope of winning
her, however, no hope at all, hardly even a wish.
She seemed set as far beyond my reach as the stars,
and her contemplation inspired me with a realization
of my unworthiness and her divinity which was
neither humiliating nor discomforting. "For,"
thought I, "the stars shine upon us all, the noble
and the base alike, and who shall say that they
discriminate between the ardent looks of worshippers?"
</P>

<P>
The bell rang and I opened the door for Mr. Sefton
Dagmar. In one second I comprehended why Sir
William disliked his nephew. My master, for all his
faults, was a deep-natured man of large mental
mould. Before me stood his absolute antithesis.
I saw a small, shallow, smiling, cunning face, that
betrayed to the keen observer every emotion of the
mind. The features were regular, even handsome,
yet puny, and the soul that looked out of his eyes
was facile, treacherous and sycophantic. He wore
a slight yellow moustache, and his eyebrows were
white. He looked too young. I judged him to be
twenty-five. He was tall and very slight; he wore
a pale brown overcoat and a suit beneath of tasteless
checked tweed.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Sefton Dagmar?" I asked with deference.
</P>

<P>
He nodded, looking me swiftly up and down.
"Uncle in?" he airily demanded.
</P>

<P>
"No, sir; but I expect him shortly. Will you
step inside?"
</P>

<P>
"Might as well," he drawled, but he entered with
alacrity, and I led the way to the ante-chamber.
</P>

<P>
"Where is my uncle?" he enquired, as I removed
his overcoat.
</P>

<P>
"I do not know, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"He got my card, I suppose?"
</P>

<P>
"Not yet, sir. He has been away."
</P>

<P>
"All night?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes sir."
</P>

<P>
He whistled then faced me with a cunning smile.
"You are new," he began. "Where is Butts?"
</P>

<P>
"He left a month ago."
</P>

<P>
"What is your name?"
</P>

<P>
"Brown, sir?"
</P>

<P>
He nodded, eyeing me as a cat might a mouse.
"You look a good sort," he declared presently.
"How do you get on with my uncle, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
I affected to hesitate. "Fairly well, thank you,
sir," I replied stammering a little.
</P>

<P>
"That means damned poorly," he retorted,
nodding his head again. "Oh! I know him, Brown;
I know him, you need'nt tell me. Why Brown, I'm
his only living relative, his sole heir, and how do you
think he treats me?"
</P>

<P>
"I'm sure I don't know, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"He allows me a paltry three hundred a year, on
the condition that I live in Newhaven with a beastly
solicitor fellow to whom he made me sign articles!"
</P>

<P>
"That seems very hard, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Hard, Brown," he cried, his eyes agleam,
"Hard! you call it hard! Why the old monster
is a millionaire, and as I told you before I am his
only living relative!"
</P>

<P>
I put on an expression of shocked sympathy.
"It is almost incredible!" I gasped.
</P>

<P>
He gave me a grateful look. "It is true, though!"
he declared, "true as gospel. And the only excuse
he could rake up for doing it was that I outran the
constable a bit at Oxford. He's the meanest old
skin-flint in the United Kingdom!"
</P>

<P>
"I wish I could help you, sir," I murmured in
my most reverential manner. "It seems very hard
and really wrong, sir, that a nice handsome young
gentleman like you, if you'll pardon me for speaking
so, sir, to your face, should be tied up in a little
village like Newhaven when you might be enjoying
yourself and seeing life in London and Paris, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"As I ought to be," he cried hotly, evidently
stirred to anger at my picture of his misfortune.
"It's a cursed shame, Brown, a cursed shame!"
</P>

<P>
"It is indeed, sir. I only wish I could help you,
sir."
</P>

<P>
He gave me a thoughtful look. "You never
know," he muttered, "the mouse helped the lion!"
</P>

<P>
I nearly laughed in his face, but controlling the
impulse I said instead&mdash;"And with the best of good
will, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"You're a damned good fellow, Brown!" he
cried with energy. "And when I am Sir Sefton
Dagmar I shall not forget you." His voice sank
into a low confidential key. "By the way, Brown,
there is a small service you might render me."
</P>

<P>
"Anything," I answered eagerly, "I'd do anything
for <i>you</i>, sir!"
</P>

<P>
He grinned with pleasure, the callow youth.
"It's nothing much," he muttered. "Only I want
you to tell me exactly how your master is&mdash;the state
of his health, I mean. I can never get any satisfaction
out of him, and I have a lot of friends who
want to know." He sighed and frowned.
</P>

<P>
<i>Post obit</i> bond-holders&mdash;was my reflection.
</P>

<P>
"I don't think he will live very long, sir," I whispered,
looking nervously about me. "At night he
coughs something dreadful, sir, and he just lives
on medicines."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sefton Dagmar's face looked for a moment
like that of a happy cherub.
</P>

<P>
"Do you really think so, Brown?" he cried
excitedly.
</P>

<P>
"I'm sure of it, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Well, see here, Brown, when he dies, I'll make
you my man, if you like!"
</P>

<P>
"Will you really, sir?" I tried to look extravagantly
delighted.
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;and I'll give you twice as much screw as
you get now, whatever he gives you. But for that
I'll expect you to do some things for me in the
meanwhile." He looked me keenly in the eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Anything at all, sir," I protested.
</P>

<P>
"Very good. I want you to drop me a line every
week to tell me how he is, and if he takes any sudden
turn for the worse you may send me a telegram."
</P>

<P>
"Certainly, sir. Is that all?"
</P>

<P>
"No!" He glanced anxiously towards the
door. "No one can hear us, can they?"
</P>

<P>
"There's no one in the house, sir, but you and me."
</P>

<P>
"That's famous; well, Brown, see here, I'm heavily
in debt and some of the beggars are pressing me
into a corner. That's why I came up to town."
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"And&mdash;and&mdash;" his face changed colour, "there
is a woman too!" he stammered, "an actress!"
</P>

<P>
"There's always a woman, I should think, where
a handsome young gentleman like you, sir, is concerned,"
I murmured with a sympathetic smile.
</P>

<P>
His vanity was tickled, but the conceited grin
my words had called to his lips quickly faded into
a look of anxiety. The matter was manifestly
serious.
</P>

<P>
"They are the devil, Brown," he solemnly assured
me. "This one has got me into a dickens own
mess, she's as pretty as a picture, Brown, but a
perfect brute all the same!"
</P>

<P>
"Breach of promise, sir?"
</P>

<P>
He nodded, with a lugubrious frown. "I've been
served with a writ," he muttered, "and there's
nothing for it but to make a clean breast to the
governor!"
</P>

<P>
"Can I help you in any way, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"I thought you might have something to suggest
as to how I should broach it to him, Brown. When
is he in the best humour&mdash;morning, afternoon or
evening?"
</P>

<P>
"If you'd take my advice, sir," I replied, "you'll
not tell your uncle at all, sir. He can't last long,
and I should think that, as you are a lawyer, you
ought to be able to stave off the proceedings for a
month or so. If you were to confess, he'd be bound to
be terribly annoyed, and the odds are he'd do you
some injury in his will. He knows he is dying, sir."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sefton Dagmar turned quite pale. "I never
thought of that!" he cried. "By Jove, so he
might. He might cut me off with a shilling. The
entail is barred long enough ago."
</P>

<P>
I was dying to get him out of the house, if only for
half an hour. I had hit upon the tail end of a
plan.
</P>

<P>
"It would never do to run such a risk!" I assured
him. "And if you'll allow me to guide you, sir,
you'll run away at once. He will be here in a
minute, and the odds are that he'll come in bad
tempered."
</P>

<P>
"I'll go!" he replied. "But, Brown, I'd like
to see him, just to be sure how he is looking."
</P>

<P>
"Then come back in an hour or two. But be
sure, sir, and say nothing about your having been
here before. He's a terribly suspicious man, and if
he thought that you and I had been conferring, he
would dismiss me straight off the reel!"
</P>

<P>
"Never fear, Brown. I wouldn't have you
sacked for the world. You'll be too useful to me
here."
</P>

<P>
"I really believe I shall, sir."
</P>

<P>
In another moment he had gone, and I watched
him walking up the street, through a slit in the
blind, until he had disappeared. It was exactly
twenty minutes past ten. I hurried to my master's
study and, quick as thought, turned the whole place
topsy turvy. I ransacked his private drawers and
scattered their contents broadcast, I even overturned
his heap of reference books. I heard the latch turn
in the front door as I descended the stairs.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, it is you at last, sir. Thank God!" I cried
as Sir William Dagmar appeared.
</P>

<P>
He was looking like a ghost, white and utterly
wearied out, and his chin was sunk upon his chest;
but my words startled him, and he turned on me
with compressed lips, in sudden energy.
</P>

<P>
"What is the matter, Brown?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, if you please, sir, I have had a terrible night!"
(I poured out the words in a perfect stream.) "Just
as I was going to bed, sir, it was about eight o'clock,
sir, for I was uncommon tired, the bell rang. I
went down to open the door and there you were
standing, at least I thought it was you, sir. He
looked exactly like you, and he spoke like you, sir,
and he called me 'Brown,' sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Great God!" exclaimed my master, and he fell
to trembling like a leaf. "What is that you say,
but wait! wait!&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
He staggered into the dining room and clutched
a decanter of spirit, which he held up with a shaking
hand to his lips. He took a deep draught, and then
broke into a frightful fit of coughing. I tended
upon him as gently as a woman, and half led, half
carried him to a sofa, where I forced him to lie down.
But his anxiety was in flames, and as soon as he
could he sat up and commanded me to proceed.
</P>

<P>
"What did this&mdash;this double of me say and do?"
he gasped. "Tell me quickly!"
</P>

<P>
"He went straight up stairs, sir. He was there
about half an hour, and then your study bell rang.
He was standing by your desk with your time-table
in his hand, sir. He said to me&mdash;'I suppose,
Brown, you thought I had gone to Newhaven!'
</P>

<P>
"'Yes, sir,' said I, and he laughed like anything,
just as though he was very much amused about
something, and all the while I thought he was you,
sir. The only thing was, sir, that he wore a different
overcoat, and I kept wondering what you had done
with your fur coat, sir. He was searching the time-table,
and presently, sir, he looked over at me and
he said&mdash;'Why, Brown, if I'd gone to Newhaven,
I couldn't have got back until ten fifteen to-morrow
morning.'
</P>

<P>
"'Indeed, sir!' says I. And at that he simply
roared out laughing. 'Brown,' he cries, 'you'll
be the death of me!' I was very much astonished,
sir, and I thought that you'd taken leave of your
senses, sir, but after you&mdash;that is to say&mdash;<i>he</i>&mdash;after
he'd got over his laughing&mdash;he looks me in the face
and says&mdash;says he&mdash;'Brown, you fool, 'can't you
see I'm not your master! Here look at my thumbs!'
And sure enough, sir, he had both his thumbs quite
complete, sir, and then I knew he couldn't be you,
sir! I was that dumbfounded for a bit, sir, that I
was ready to sink through the floor, and all I could
do was just gape at his hands. Then of a sudden
he whips one of them into his pocket, sir, and he
pulled out a pistol, which he clapped to my head.
'Listen to me, Brown!' says he, very quiet like,
but in a terrible voice, sir, 'Listen to me, Brown!'
says he. 'Your master is in Newhaven by now, and
he can't get back till the morning. When he comes
tell him from me, that his double will find out to-night
all he wants to know, and that he'll hear from
me within a week. Tell him, too, that he needn't
bother suspecting young Sefton, I could have got
the young ass to help me if I'd wanted, but he was too
great a fool, and I scorn to have him blamed. Tell
Sir William I'm playing a lone hand, and that it
rests with him to keep it a lone hand. And now,
Brown, you just stay here for the next half hour,
while I go through the house, and don't you budge,
or as sure as death I'll plug a bullet through your
brains!'
</P>

<P>
"With that, sir, he dragged me into a corner, and
put my face to the wall&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I stayed
there, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"What!" thundered my master. "How long?"
</P>

<P>
I began to whimper. "I&mdash;I&mdash;take shame to
admit I played the coward, sir," I blubbed out.
</P>

<P>
"But if&mdash;if you'd heard him&mdash;speak, sir&mdash;and seen
the look in his eyes&mdash;sir&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;may be&mdash;&mdash;'"
</P>

<P>
"Enough!" he interjected very sharply. "I'm
not blaming you, my man, I'm asking for information.
How long did you stay in the corner where he
put you?"
</P>

<P>
"A long while, sir."
</P>

<P>
"How soon did he leave the house?"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know, sir. I seemed to hear noises for
hours and hours, sir&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;" here I broke
down with a really artistic sob. "It's turned me
quite grey, sir&mdash;all about the temples&mdash;and I was
brown as brown&mdash;last evening, sir!"
</P>

<P>
Sir William got to his feet and placed a hand
upon my shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"There, there, Brown, compose yourself!" he
said in kinder tones. "I can see that you have had
a great fright, and you were right to run no risks.
But tell me did you send for the police after you
discovered that the man had gone?"
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;no, sir," I stammered. "You told me on
no account to leave the house!"
</P>

<P>
"Brown!" he cried indignantly.
</P>

<P>
"Well, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;simply daren't venture outside
the house, sir!" I blurted out.
</P>

<P>
My master frowned and shook his head. "Just
as well, perhaps!" he muttered to himself. He
added in a louder key. "Well, my man, you have
given me much to think over, and I have trouble
enough upon my hands already."
</P>

<P>
"Trouble, sir!" I repeated.
</P>

<P>
"A dear friend of mine is dead. You know
him, Brown, Mr. George Cavanagh. He shot himself
last night in his studio!"
</P>

<P>
It was on the tip of my tongue to scream out&mdash;"in
his studio!" I was so surprised, but I restrained
myself just in time and cried instead:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Good heavens! sir, how awful! Why did he
do it, sir?"
</P>

<P>
Sir William shrugged his shoulders. "They say
that it was in a fit of despair, because the great
picture he was painting was accidentally destroyed by
fire. But you may read for yourself, Brown, the
morning papers are full of it!"
</P>

<P>
The papers! I had never even thought to look
at one. I had been so preoccupied. My master
went on speaking. "I'll go upstairs, Brown, and
have a bath," he said, "after which I shall attend
the inquest!"
</P>

<P>
"But your double, sir!" I cried. "Ought not
we to tell the police at once about him, sir?"
</P>

<P>
He shook his head. "No, no, Brown. Better not,
better not. He is probably some friend of mine
who has been playing a practical joke at my expense.
Keep what has happened to yourself,
Brown. I do not wish to be laughed at!"
</P>

<P>
"Very good, sir," I muttered dubiously. "But
all the same I don't think he was joking, sir. I'll be
bound you'll find he has robbed you. The study
is just upside down! I have not tried to put it in
order, sir, so that you might see it as he left
it!"
</P>

<P>
Sir William gave me a wan smile. "I keep no
valuables in the house, Brown," he replied, "except
my manuscripts, and they are worthless to anyone
but myself."
</P>

<P>
Without another word he left the room, and I
also hurried out in order to prepare his bath. I
did not venture to converse with him again, for he
had fallen into one of his impenetrable silent moods
which inevitably stirred him to wrath against any
interrupter. As soon as I had dressed him he left
the house, still steeped in speechless thought. He
looked ten years older than he had the previous day,
and I felt really sorry to remember the additional
cup of fear and horror he would be called upon to
drink when he and the others had ascertained the
full extent and import of my most recent impersonation.
</P>

<P>
After he had gone, I snatched open the first
paper that came to my hand. It was the <i>Morning
Mail</i>. I discovered the black scare headline
in a second. Yes, sure enough it related how Mr.
Cavanagh's valet had found his master lying on the
studio floor a little after midnight, stone dead, with
a revolver clutched in his right hand. The man had
not heard the shot, but he had been awakened by
some noise, and he had thought his master had called
out to him. He admitted that he was a heavy
sleeper, and he did not remember hearing Mr.
Cavanagh enter the house. The artist's great picture
upon which he had been working for a year, and
which was almost finished, was half destroyed by
fire, and it looked as though by accident, for a naked
gas jet burned perilously close to the easel. The bullet
which had killed Mr. Cavanagh had been found by
the police embedded in the plaster of a distant wall,
near the ceiling. The writer of the article had
ingeniously concluded that the artist on entering his
studio and observing the fruit of his ardent labours
destroyed beyond repair, had, in the first sharp flush
of his despair, committed suicide!
</P>

<P>
As for me, when I scanned the page and considered
one by one the circumstantial dove-tailing details
of that ghastly history&mdash;I confess that for a moment
I doubted my senses' evidence. A little reflection,
however, brought me to a realization of the truth,
and a greater respect than ever for a certain eminent
surgeon&mdash;to wit&mdash;Sir Charles Venner. I saw in
everything I read, his calm, cold-blooded scheming.
On my last glimpse he had been languidly smoking
a cigarette, which he must have lighted before the
breath had quite departed from poor Cavanagh's
mutilated corpse. Perhaps nay, undoubtedly, he
had even then been planning how to act, and so
arrange matters that no scandal might be associated
with the name of his accursed hospital.
</P>

<P>
As clearly as though I had been present I saw him
ordering that dreadful funeral; saw him take
Cavanagh's latch-key from his chain; saw him direct
one of the negroes to prepare a conveyance; saw
him lead the negroes carrying the body to a waiting
vehicle&mdash;and that silent cortége move across the
Heath to St. John's Wood. I saw him then open
Mr. Cavanagh's door and noiselessly motion the
negroes to bear the corpse within. I watched him
dispose the body on the floor with scientific calculation
as to the proper direction of the bullet, and
then climbing upon a chair or perhaps on the negroes'
shoulders force the bullet through the curtain into
the plaster. Perhaps that noise had awakened
Cavanagh's drowsy headed servant! I saw him
approach the easel and set fire to the great picture,
so as to supply the world with a motive for the
suicide&mdash;and finally I saw him steal away with his
ebony attendants from the house&mdash;three dark
malignant spirits, veritable caterers of death!
</P>

<P>
Somehow I shuddered to think of Sir Charles
Venner. I felt him to be a foeman more worthy of
my steel than all his fellows, and I half wished, half
feared to cross swords with him. It is true that
already I had twice managed to out-wit him, and
he had not dreamed in either case of doubting my
assumed identity. But I could not claim much
credit in the latter bout, nor feel much satisfaction,
since throughout that awful evening Sir Charles had
been too occupied to do more than throw a hasty
glance in my direction. What would happen, I
wondered, in a real fair battle of wits, each of us
forewarned of the encounter? I had profound
faith in my powers and resources, but I dared not
forecast that issue! Twice we had met, and twice
I had succeeded. Would we strive again, and who
would win on the third and fatal meeting?
</P>

<P>
Such were the questions I asked myself unceasingly;
but I could answer none of them.
</P>

<P>
It was not until almost four o'clock in the afternoon
that my master returned home, and he was
accompanied by Sir Charles Venner and Dr. Fulton.
I was at once called into the study and put through
a rigid cross-examination, by all three, regarding
my pretended visitor of the previous evening. But
I had expected such an ordeal, and I came through
with colours flying. I was much concerned, however,
to perceive that Sir William Dagmar looked very
ill. He coughed incessantly and so haggard and
careworn was his visage that I believed he would
presently collapse. My prognostications were justified
by the event. Soon after I had been dismissed
the bell rang violently, and I hurried upstairs to see
the two surgeons carrying my master's unconscious
body to the bedroom. I undressed him there and
put him to bed; whereupon they carefully examined
him, and held a long and anxious consultation over
his condition. An hour passed before he recovered
from his swoon, but even when he awoke it was not
to his proper senses, for he immediately began to
babble a stream of meaningless nonsense. The
surgeons looking very grave agreed to administer
an opiate, and they injected some fluid hypodermically
into his arm.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles then informed me that they feared a
serious attack of meningitis, and he promised to
send a trained nurse within an hour to look after
the sick man. He left at once, but Dr. Fulton
remained until my master went to sleep. The nurse
arrived half an hour later, and I prepared one of
the spare bed-rooms for her use. She was an angular
hard-featured woman named Hargreaves, but she
had a soft voice and pleasing manners, and she
seemed to know her business. Mr. Sefton Dagmar
arrived at about seven o'clock. As soon as he heard
that his uncle was ill and likely to die, he went half
crazy with joy and insisted upon staying in the
house. I did not wish him to at all, but there was
nothing for me to do except put up with the infliction,
and prepare another bed-room. However,
he sent me out soon after dinner to despatch a
telegram to Newhaven for his baggage, and for
that little involuntary service that he did me, I became
reconciled to his presence. The fact was, I
needed an excuse to quit the house upon business
of my own. Ever since my master had swooned I
had been thinking very hard, and it seemed to me
that if I wished to improve my fortunes, I must strike
at once before all the geese, whom I expected to
lay me golden eggs, should die. Having sent Mr.
Sefton Dagmar's wire, I took a cab to Cheapside
and sought out a cheap stationer's shop. I bought
some common note paper and envelopes, and begging
the loan of a pen, I scratched in straggling print the
following epistle to Sir Charles Venner:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Sir&mdash;If you will inquire at the Colonnade Hotel
for Mr. Seth Halford to-morrow evening at nine
o'clock, you will be shown to a room, where you will
find Dagmar the second. Kindly bring money and
come alone!"
</P>

<P>
I posted this letter at the G.P.O., and returned to
Curzon Street. In the morning Sir William Dagmar
was in a high fever and raving deliriously. As I
had a houseful to provide for, and am not a lover
of trouble, I went early abroad and arranged with
a restaurateur to supply all our meals. I then
drove in a cab to a post office in the Old Kent Road
and sent myself a telegram from my dying mother,
which arrived at noon. Sir Charles Venner visited
his patient at one, and after he had gone I showed
my telegram to Mr. Sefton Dagmar and Nurse
Hargreaves, both of whom urged me to attend the
summons, assuring me that I was not needed at the
house. I tearfully allowed their protestations to
prevail, and betook myself to my little stronghold
in Bruton Street. There arrived, I spent the rest of
that day making myself up to represent the old
actor whom I had impersonated on the occasion
when I had shadowed my master to the Kingsmere
Hospital for Consumptives. For a purpose, to be
afterwards explained, I furnished my pockets with
a small assortment of wigs, beards and moustaches.
When darkness fell I issued forth and rode in a
cab to the Colonnade Hotel. The clerk stared at
me rather haughtily when I asked for a room in so
swell a place, but I satisfied his scruples with half
a sovereign, which tip no doubt induced him to
believe me an eccentric millionaire. I told him that
I expected a visitor, my friend, Sir Charles Venner,
the great surgeon, at nine o'clock, and desired him
to be shown up at once to my bedroom. After
that he was all obsequiousness. I dined at the
hotel, and to fortify myself for the fray I drank a
small bottle of sparkling burgundy. At a quarter
to nine I repaired to my room, which was situated
near the first angle of the building on turning from
the staircase, on the second floor. It was furnished
in the ordinary style very plainly and simply. I
quickly stripped the dressing-table of its contents
and placed it in the middle floor. I set a chair on
either side of the table, and I sat down upon the one
that faced the door&mdash;which I had left unlatched&mdash;I
then put on a pair of goggles and waited.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner was praiseworthily punctual.
Big Ben was still chiming the hour when I heard his
tap on the panel.
</P>

<P>
"Come in!" I cried.
</P>

<P>
The handle turned and he entered, just pausing
on the threshold to tip the waiter who had brought
him up.
</P>

<P>
"My dear old chap!" I exclaimed for the waiter's
benefit, "this is good of you, as ever, punctual to
the tick!"
</P>

<P>
He closed the door carefully behind him, and
advanced towards the table, pulling off his gloves as
he did so. I, on the contrary, had been careful to
keep my hands thickly gloved, for I wanted those
keen eyes of his to have as few recognizing details
as possible to remember, and hands are tell tale
things, as I had proved sufficiently already.
</P>

<P>
"I suppose I may be seated!" he began in steady
tones.
</P>

<P>
I nodded, eating him with my gaze. His countenance
was perfectly impassive, but his eyes returned
my stare with penetrating interest.
</P>

<P>
He sat down and calmly crossed his knees. "My
time is limited," he declared. "Kindly proceed
to business. You sent for me and I am here!"
</P>

<P>
I bowed my head. "True, Sir Charles," I replied
in an assumed voice. "I do not propose to
detain you long. The Kingsmere Hospital for
Consumptives doubtless claims your care, so I shall
be as brief as possible!"
</P>

<P>
I watched him sharply, but he did not turn a hair
nor move a muscle. "Go on!" was all he said.
</P>

<P>
"Shall we avoid details?" I enquired.
</P>

<P>
"Unnecessary details, sir. But tell me all you
know!"
</P>

<P>
"Not very much!" I said gently. "Unlawful
secret society! We'll call that number one, and
bracket with it George Cavanagh's death by suicide."
A look of relief crossed his face at the word suicide.
I smiled and proceeded. "Number two: Vivisection
is unlawful&mdash;I fancy&mdash;and you might be convicted
of murder on my showing. It would be for
a jury to determine, for all the great surgeon that
you are. I think that is enough Sir Charles!"
</P>

<P>
"Bah!" said he, and a curious gleam came into
his eyes. "You can scandalize and perhaps destroy
my practice, that is all. I admit you have me in a
chain, but take care not to strain the bond too far.
I do not depend upon my practice for a living, and
in the cause of science I shall dare to face scandal,
if you press me!"
</P>

<P>
"I am glad to hear that you have a private
fortune," I answered quietly. "I have the less
compunction in asking you to contribute to another
man's support. The world's wealth is distributed
very unevenly, Sir Charles. Do you not agree
with me?"
</P>

<P>
For the first time a shade of annoyance crossed
his face. "I must decline to discuss abstractions
with a blackmailer," he replied in irritated tones.
"What is your name, and what is your price?"
</P>

<P>
"My name for the present is Seth Halford, Sir
Charles. I shall not deny that it is liable to frequent
change&mdash;" I smiled&mdash;"but I defy you to detect its
transmutations, sir, or follow its vicarious possessor
to his lair. As for my price, I have no object in
withholding that&mdash;It is ten thousand pounds!"
</P>

<P>
"And is it not subject, like your name, to change?"
</P>

<P>
"Not by so much as one farthing, Sir Charles."
</P>

<P>
He nodded and got languidly to his feet. "I
came here prepared to sacrifice five hundred," he
said quietly. "Two in cash, the balance to-morrow.
I am not sure that I am not pleased to save the
money."
</P>

<P>
"Will you save it?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
"Unless you hedge immediately in your outrageously
extravagant demand."
</P>

<P>
"Unhappily, Sir Charles, that is utterly impossible."
</P>

<P>
"Then I shall save it!"
</P>

<P>
"How?"
</P>

<P>
"By calling in the police and arresting you for
attempted blackmail."
</P>

<P>
I broke into a soft rippling laugh. "So&mdash;" I
muttered, "you only value your neck at five hundred
pounds! Such fine and delicate vertebrae
they are too!"
</P>

<P>
The irony brought some colour to his cheek. "My
neck is in no danger," he retorted angrily. "What
can you prove against us you fool, except that I
performed a wonderful operation in the cause of
science, in the ardent hope of saving a man's life,
and in the sure trust of benefitting the whole human
race?"
</P>

<P>
"But the man died, doctor, and he was one of nineteen!
The coroner will shortly have a harvest,
nineteen autopsies, Sir Charles! Think of them!
Nineteen autopsies!"
</P>

<P>
"You fool," he repeated in tones of repressed
passion, "if there were even ninety&mdash;what of it?
But enough of this! choose between five hundred
pounds and the lock-up. Choose quickly!"
</P>

<P>
He turned as he spoke and strode to the door.
His hand was already on the latch. In another
second the door would have been thrown wide.
Perhaps there was a policeman in the passage, I
thought it unlikely but still&mdash;possible! At all
events it was time for me to cease trifling with my
adversary.
</P>

<P>
"You appear, Sir Charles Venner, to have forgotten
the matter of Cavanagh's death!" I hissed
out. "He killed himself at the hospital, and his
body was discovered at the studio!"
</P>

<P>
"That can be explained!" he retorted; but his
hand fell softly from the latch. "We have plenty
of witnesses who saw his suicide."
</P>

<P>
"Suicide!" I sneered. "What <i>of rule three, you
one of seven murderers</i>!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner re-crossed the room and quietly
resumed his chair. His face was still as expressionless
as a mask, but all the lustre had departed from
his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"What do you know of rule three?" he asked in
lifeless tones after a long intense pause.
</P>

<P>
I knew so little that it seemed necessary to lie.
"Enough to hang you," I murmured, smiling
pleasantly. "I should tell you perhaps, my dear
Sir Charles, that I have impersonated Sir William
Dagmar more often than I have fingers and toes&mdash;during
the past twelve months. Ha! you start!"
I laughed wickedly. "Did you really permit
yourself to dream that you have guessed the full
extent of my depredations on your order&mdash;from
your one or two chance and predestined discoveries.
Oh! oh! Ha! ha! This is really too good!"
</P>

<P>
He bit his lips and eyed me sternly. "I shall
need better proof than your word," he said.
</P>

<P>
I nodded, got to my feet and strode to the door.
I threw it open and with an elaborate bow pointed
to the passage.
</P>

<P>
"You shall have it," I cried, "but only in the
police court!"
</P>

<P>
"Bluff!" he sneered. "Bluff!" He did not
move from his chair.
</P>

<P>
"Oh!" said I, "you choose to pay yourself a
compliment! So you think I would follow your
example of a moment since? But you are wrong!"
I walked to the electric bell and pressed the button.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner's impassivity disappeared
like magic. His face turned scarlet and he sprang
instantly afoot.
</P>

<P>
"Curse you!" he grated out, "what would you
do?"
</P>

<P>
"Sir, our interview is at an end. My servant
will show you to the street!"
</P>

<P>
"The sum you ask is utterly beyond our means!"
</P>

<P>
I shrugged my shoulders.
</P>

<P>
"Five thousand!" he hissed.
</P>

<P>
I yawned.
</P>

<P>
"Seven then, though it will ruin us!" he cried
distractedly.
</P>

<P>
I took out a cigarette and struck a light. He
watched me expel five puffs of vapour from my
mouth, but I did not so much as glance at him.
Then a servant appeared in the doorway.
</P>

<P>
"You rang, sir?" he enquired.
</P>

<P>
"Yes!" I looked at the fellow approvingly.
He was a much stouter man and perhaps an inch
taller than I, and he had large feet. He was attired
in the hotel uniform. He wore a dragoon's moustache,
and he looked like an old soldier. "I wish
you to be good enough to show my dear friend, Sir
Charles Venner, to the street." I turned to Sir
Charles and immediately perceived that my adversary
had become my victim.
</P>

<P>
"When and where shall we meet again?" he
muttered hoarsely.
</P>

<P>
"Ten?" said I. He was grey, grey to his lips.
His eyes shone like stars.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, ten!" he replied.
</P>

<P>
"I'll drop you a line!" I said with a smile.
"But how careless of me, I almost forget my hospital
subscription list. How much may I put you
down for? You know the cause is a deserving one.
Shall we say two hundred pounds?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh, I suppose so," he said.
</P>

<P>
"Cash, old chap? Or will you send me a cheque?"
I frowned as our eyes met, and he read my meaning.
</P>

<P>
"I brought the money with me," he replied.
"I may as well hand it over to you now. I shall
thereby save a postage stamp!" He threw a
bundle of notes upon the table.
</P>

<P>
I smiled again and looking steadily into his eyes
held out one hand. "Well, good night to you, old
boy&mdash;sleep well&mdash;and be good till we meet again!"
</P>

<P>
I fancy Sir Charles Venner had never been submitted
to a more intolerable piece of degradation.
To be commanded to shake hands with one's blackmailer!
His eyes were simply murderous, but he
obeyed. It was only a form of course, for our
fingers barely touched, but his involuntary shiver
of repulsion was communicated to my frame even
in that swift contact, and I had enough fine feeling
in me to appreciate his passionate disgust. To be
candid, I liked him all the better because of it, for
although there is not a spark of pride in my composition,
a constitutional weakness obliges me to
respect pride in other people.
</P>

<P>
Five minutes after he had gone, I left my room
and strolled to the head of the stairs. As I had
expected, a gentleman was seated upon the lounge
that faced the door of the elevator, I could not see
his face for it was concealed behind a newspaper.
But I marked one incongruous circumstance in his
apparel. He wore evening dress, and ordinary
street boots of black leather. I am afraid I was so
vulgar as to permit myself the indulgence of a wink.
I passed him and leisurely descended the first
flight of stairs. Of a sudden I stopped, and turning
about ran upstairs again at the top of my speed,
taking three steps at a time. My gentleman had
already begun to descend the stairs. I passed him
without a glance, swearing in a low but audible key
at my forgetfulness. In another moment I was
back in my room pressing the electric button.
"So!" thought I, "they have employed a detective
to shadow me. Well, we shall see!"
</P>

<P>
Presently a knock sounded on the door, and the
waiter entered, who had shown Sir Charles out.
</P>

<P>
"Shut it," I said. He obeyed.
</P>

<P>
"What is your name?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Martin, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Well, look here, Martin," said I, "my old
friend Sir Charles Venner has just bet me a hundred
pounds that I cannot succeed in getting out of this
hotel in some disguise, without his suspecting me,
during the next half hour. Now he is waiting in
the vestibule, is he not?"
</P>

<P>
The waiter grinned. "No, sir, just inside the
coffee room door; I was wondering what he wanted.
He gave me half a crown, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Half a crown!" I sneered. "Look here
Martin&mdash;&mdash;" I took Sir Charles' own roll from my
pocket and selected two brand new five pound notes.
"Now Sir Charles thinks himself very smart, and he
fancies he can see through a disguise in a second.
But I reckon a bit on my smartness too, for when
I was a young man before I made a fortune out of
mining I was on the stage. With your help, my
man, I'll do Sir Charles up, do him brown&mdash;and
these notes will be yours for helping me!"
</P>

<P>
Martin's eyes almost burst out of their sockets.
"All right, sir!" he cried excitedly. "What do
you want me to do?"
</P>

<P>
"Exchange clothes with me for ten minutes.
Here are the notes, my man&mdash;I'll pay you beforehand.
All I'll have to do to win my bet is to slip
out of the house and return. Hurry up, Martin!"
</P>

<P>
But Martin had already begun to slip off his coat.
The bank notes were tightly clutched between his
teeth, so he could not reply, but I was rather glad
of that. I induced him to remove even his boots,
and in five minutes I was to all appearances a hotel
waiter. A false moustache gave me a general look
of Martin, but a glance in the mirror showed me a
bad fault, the long hair of my previous character,
the old Shakesperean actor, fell upon my collar,
while Martin's hair was cropped closely to his head.
But I dared not exchange the wig I was wearing for
another in Martin's presence, for fear of exciting his
distrust, neither dared I remove my false bushy
grey eyebrows.
</P>

<P>
Difficulties, however, are made to be surmounted.
Whispering a word of warning in Martin's ear, I
opened the door, and in a loud voice commanded
him to procure me a cab. Martin cried out&mdash;"Very
good, sir!" and I slipped into the passage, banging
the door behind me. My trick was successful, the
corridor was deserted. In two seconds I had pulled
off my wig and substituted another, also I tore off
my false eyebrows and stuffed them into my pocket,
that is to say, into Martin's pocket. I then strode
down the corridor and turned the corner with the
brisk step and manner of a waiter going on an urgent
message. My gentleman spy was again seated on
the lounge that faced the elevator, and once more
intrenched behind a newspaper.
</P>

<P>
He threw at me one quick glance over the edge
of the journal, and his face vanished. I had just
time to photograph his features on my mind&mdash;no
more. Running down the stairs I reached the vestibule,
which to my delight was thronged with guests.
A moment later, having given the coffee room a
wide berth, I passed through the open hall door and
gained the street. A gentleman was standing
on the footpath paying off a cab from which he had
just alighted. I sprang into the vehicle and drove
to Piccadilly Circus. A second took me to Marble
Arch, and a third to Bruton Street. Feeling
assured that I had not been followed, I slipped
upstairs and into my room.
</P>

<P>
An hour later, Brown, Sir William Dagmar's
discreet valet, stepped out of an omnibus before the
General Post Office, letter in hand addressed to Sir
Charles Venner. The letter, which was subscribed
in printed characters, contained these words:&mdash;"To-morrow
afternoon, at 4.30, inquire at Bolingbroke
Hotel, Piccadilly, for Dr. Rudolf Garschagen.
Bank of England notes alone acceptable. Dagmar
II."
</P>

<P>
I slept that night at Bruton Street.

A BATTLE OF WITS
</H4>

<P>
At ten o'clock on the next morning, as I approached
my master's house in Curzon Street,
I saw Sir Charles Venner's brougham waiting before
the door. I thought it highly probable that Sir
Charles would require me to give an account of my
absence from duty, whether he suspected me or not,
for he was in the position of a man obliged by circumstances
to suspect everyone, even his nearest
and dearest friend. Nerving myself for the encounter,
I assumed a dejected and lugubrious expression,
and slowly mounting the steps, I inserted
my latch-key in the lock. The hall was deserted,
but I heard a mutter of voices in the ante-room,
and thither I betook myself at once. "Best get it
over quickly," was my thought.
</P>

<P>
The door was ajar, and peering through I perceived
Mr. Sefton Dagmar and Sir Charles Venner in earnest
converse. Mr. Dagmar's hat was lying upon the
table. Sir Charles carried his in his hand. I rapped
softly upon the panel and entered.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, Brown!" exclaimed the younger man.
"Back, I see."
</P>

<P>
"Good morning, sir," I muttered, and turning
to Sir Charles I anxiously enquired after my master.
</P>

<P>
"Your master is much worse!" he replied, looking
at me very keenly. "I expect the crisis to-night!"
</P>

<P>
"He will recover, sir, I hope. You will surely
save him, Sir Charles!"
</P>

<P>
"I don't know!"
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sefton Dagmar took up his hat and left the
room, throwing me a wink as he passed. "I think
it's up to me to take a constitutional," he observed,
by way of excusing his departure. "Au revoir,
Sir Charles!"
</P>

<P>
"Au revoir!" returned the surgeon. His eyes
had never left my face. He waited until we heard
the street door close, then he said quietly: "And
how is your mother, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
"She is dead, sir!" I spoke the words in a low,
dull tone, but without attempting any exhibition of
emotion. I knew better than to play such a game
with the man before me.
</P>

<P>
"I'm sorry to hear that," he observed. "You'll
want to attend her funeral, I suppose. When is
she to be buried?"
</P>

<P>
"This afternoon, sir," I answered looking at the
floor.
</P>

<P>
He drew in a long, sharp inspiration, which said
plainer than words: "I thought so!"
</P>

<P>
I understood that he suspected me. I raised my
eyes to his, however, with a worried melancholy
expression, and I said in a hesitating way. "It's
very good of you, sir, to sympathize with me&mdash;I'm
sure&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;feel almost emboldened to take a
liberty. I'm, I'm in great trouble, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, Brown?" His eyes were gleaming like
drawn swords.
</P>

<P>
"It's this way, sir," I muttered. "My mother's
illness has run away&mdash;with my little bit of savings,
sir&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;the undertaker wants spot cash
for the coffin, sir. He won't trust me, and I don't
know what to do, seeing master is so ill. It'd be
all right, if he was well, for I haven't drawn my last
month's wages, sir."
</P>

<P>
"I see, you wish me to lend you some money."
</P>

<P>
I hung my head in real artistic shame. "I'd
never dare&mdash;ask&mdash;you, sir!" I muttered brokenly,
"but since you've said it yourself, sir, I&mdash;I&mdash;" I
paused as if unable to proceed.
</P>

<P>
"How much do you need?"
</P>

<P>
"Five pounds would do, sir. Master owes me
eight, and I could make it over to you, if you'd only
be so good. You see, sir, I'd hate"&mdash;I choked&mdash;"a&mdash;a&mdash;pauper
funeral, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Naturally, my man," his voice was much kinder.
"But there will be no need for that. I shall lend
you the money with pleasure. Let me see, it's ten
now, I shall return to see your master again at twelve
and bring the money with me. I have only a few
shillings about me at this moment!"
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, sir," I stammered. "I'll never
forget it of you, sir!" At that juncture I allowed a
tear to roll down my cheek, as I raised my face to
look at him, but I brushed it hastily away, as though
ashamed.
</P>

<P>
He did not appear to notice anything, however,
and without another word he left the house. I
considered that I had allayed his suspicions, but I
dared not make too sure, for that man possessed
a more admirable control of feature than any other
I had ever known. I determined, therefore, to be
careful and remit no precaution, however small or
troublesome, in order to secure myself. To that end
I took an early opportunity of confiding my trouble
to Nurse Hargreaves, and I almost made her weep
by the touching manner in which I described my
mother's death.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles returned punctually at twelve o'clock
and he put five sovereigns into my hand as I admitted
him. He was also kind enough to tell me
that I might leave the house at once, in order to
conduct my mother's funeral arrangements. I took
him at his word. My first thought as I stepped into
the street was this:&mdash;"Am I to be shadowed? And
if so, how shall I discover the spy?" The pavement
was dotted with pedestrians who all appeared to
be minding their own business. I walked briskly
towards Piccadilly. Before long I knew that I was
followed, I cannot explain how I knew, for although
I seized every opportunity I could to look back,
I could not locate my shadower; but I felt that I
was shadowed, felt it in my bones. I was thrilled,
exhilarated! Difficulties and dangers always delight
me, and always call, as with a trumpet blast,
my best faculties to action. I considered what to
do. I might easily have shaken off my pursuer had I
wished, but to even display such a desire would inevitably
convert Sir Charles Venner's suspicions into
convictions. It was my ambition, on the other hand,
to destroy his suspicions altogether. An inspiration
came to me at Piccadilly Circus. I smothered a cry
of delight, and entered an Oxford Street omnibus.
The end seat was vacant. I took it, and gazed watchfully
behind me. To even a trained observer like
myself, it was no easy task to pick out of the great
moving throng that followed my conveyance the man
whose business was wrapped up in my own. But I
did not despair, and set steadily to work. At Oxford
Circus I was sure that he had not entered my
'bus. There I alighted and took another to London
Bridge. In which of the omnibuses and cabs trailing
behind me was he then seated? Nearest of all
was a Bank 'bus; I did not believe it contained him.
Beyond that an empty hansom rolled along, then a
fourwheeler, then a greengrocer's cart, with a smart
looking pony between the shafts. I thought he
might be in the fourwheeler, but no, it turned down
Museum Street. This brought the greengrocer's
cart nearer to the empty hansom, and gave me a
chance to examine some of the passengers on a Chancery
Lane 'bus beyond. At Red Lion Street we
pulled up, and the Bank 'bus passed us with a good
start, also the empty hansom. I had now a good view
of the Chancery Lane 'bus over the greengrocer's
cart, and of another 'bus behind that, bound for
Gray's Inn Road. We soon passed Chancery Lane,
and so lost one more 'bus. The pony drawing the
greengrocer's cart was now almost touching our steps
with his nose. Not a soul of those who alighted from
the Chancery Lane 'bus came our way. I examined
the Gray's Inn Road 'bus, but it contained only three
women and a boy. Two hansoms now joined the
procession, but the first carried an eye-glassed snob,
and the other an officer in uniform. I was beginning
to feel very puzzled when it suddenly occurred to me
to prospect the greengrocer's cart, which hitherto I
had scarcely more than glanced at. Two costers
occupied the seat, but otherwise the cart was empty.
The driver was a real unmistakable hall-marked
coster, but his companion gave me a doubt. For one
thing, he was smoking a cigar; for another, he held
on to his seat in order to support himself; for a
third, although he wore no collar, he had a remarkably
white neck&mdash;for a coster.
</P>

<P>
"There," said I, "is my man."
</P>

<P>
I did not look at him again. There was no need.
To kill time I bought a paper at the next corner, and
diligently studied its contents, until we came to London
Bridge, where I alighted, and transferred myself
to a New Cross 'bus. I mounted to the top and began
to scan the houses that we passed with the closest
possible attention. It was not, however, until we
left Tabard Street behind and had half traversed
the Old Kent Road, that I discovered what I was
looking for. This was a "double event"&mdash;so to
speak. An apartment house and an undertaker's
establishment, situated within easy walking distance
of each other. Many a coffin shop did I see, and
many an apartment house, but they were unhappily
too separated for my purpose. The fortunate combination
occurred between Astley Street and Ossary
Road. First came the undertaker's shop, and then
the apartment house. Nothing could have been
more suitable. Opposite the latter I swung myself
from the 'bus, and stepped upon the footpath. The
greengrocer's cart passed me by some twenty yards
at a smart trot, then slowed down to a walk. I
strode up to the door of the apartment house, and
rapped sharply on the knocker. It was a low, grimy,
building, with many grimy windows, whose shuttered
blinds had once been green, but now were grey with
grease and dust. A card in either lower windows
signified its calling: "Apartments to let!"
</P>

<P>
The door was opened by a greasy-faced woman,
whose coal black oily locks were crimped in curl-papers.
I pushed past her into the hall, without so
much as "by your leave," and shut the door behind
me. I acted so, lest my shadower should suspect
that I visited the house for the first time. The woman
at once began to protest at the top of her voice,
against my cavalier behaviour. But I cut her short
with a sovereign, which she bit, in the fashion of her
class, eyeing me the while as though she expected
me to snatch it back again.
</P>

<P>
Silence thus secured, I addressed her in this fashion:
"Madam, I am a woodcarver by trade, and a
rich old gentleman has just commissioned me to
carve a wonderful design upon a coffin in which he
wishes to bury his wife who is lately dead. My
master, however, jealous at my good fortune, has
dismissed me from his employ, and as it is necessary
for me to get immediately to work, I must hire a
room in the neighbourhood without delay. If you
have a front room on the ground floor which you
can let to me, I shall be glad to pay you for it at the
rate of one pound for every day I use it in advance,
and give you the pound you are biting, into the
bargain!"
</P>

<P>
"Lawks!" she cried, then uttered a croaking
laugh. "You must be getting well paid for the
job!"
</P>

<P>
"A hundred pounds!" I replied.
</P>

<P>
"No wonder you are in a hurry."
</P>

<P>
"Have you such a room as I require?" I demanded
impatiently.
</P>

<P>
She opened a door at her right hand, and showed
me a musty guest chamber, which still smelt of its
former occupant, who must have been a tanner, I
should say.
</P>

<P>
"It will do," I declared.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, but will you bring the coffin here?"
</P>

<P>
"Assuredly."
</P>

<P>
"Not for a pound a day, though, mister!" she
retorted with a cunning smile. "Why, all my
boarders would clear out!"
</P>

<P>
"How much do you want, then?"
</P>

<P>
"Two quid, not a penny less."
</P>

<P>
I paid the money into her hand. Her eyes glinted
with rage and self-contempt, because she had
not demanded three, but I did not choose to
heed.
</P>

<P>
"I shall return in ten minutes with the coffin!"
I said quickly. "In the meanwhile that room is
mine. Please see that no one goes into it, and do not
on any account open the window!"
</P>

<P>
In another moment I was out of the house, and
walking back briskly towards the city, followed at a
distance by the greengrocer's cart.
</P>

<P>
The undertaker's shop was half a mile away. I
reached it in less than four minutes, and entered with
the air of a busy bourgeois.
</P>

<P>
"How much that box?" I asked of the proprietor,
pointing to an imitation oak coffin that was half
hidden behind several more showy constructions.
</P>

<P>
"Four pounds," said he.
</P>

<P>
"Could you deliver it at once?"
</P>

<P>
"No, sir, my carts are all out."
</P>

<P>
"You have attendants?"
</P>

<P>
He scratched his head, "How fur?" he questioned.
</P>

<P>
"Only a few hundred yards down the street! I'm
willing to pay an extra five shillings for promptitude."
He stepped to an open glass door and
shouted&mdash;"Jim! Frank!"
</P>

<P>
Two young men, evidently apprentices, answered
his call. I put down four sovereigns and five shillings
on the counter.
</P>

<P>
The undertaker picked up the money, and pointed
to my purchase. "Pick out the plain oak and take
it to this gentleman's house!" he commanded.
"He'll show you the way! Do you want a receipt,
sir?"
</P>

<P>
"I'll call back for it," I replied, and strode from
the shop.
</P>

<P>
The small procession that I headed occasioned a
good deal of comment, and excited not a few grisly
jests as we proceeded. But I paid no heed to any,
and marched along with the expression of a lover
lately bereaved of his sweetheart.
</P>

<P>
One pitiful "poor chap, he looks down in the
mug, Bill, don't he?" more than rewarded me for all
the honest effort I was putting forth, and compensated
for the jokes besides. I looked neither to
right nor left, and not once back; but I knew that
the greengrocer's cart still steadily dogged my
wanderings.
</P>

<P>
My new landlady admitted us without a protest.
I made my attendants place the coffin upon the bed,
and dismissed them with a shilling apiece. I then
locked the door and crept to the window. I was
just in time to see, through a slit in the shutter, the
greengrocer's cart set off at a swift trot towards London.
Cautiously raising the sash I pushed aside the
blind and craned out my head. No, I had not been
misled. The road ran straight, and although I
watched the cart until it was swallowed up in a
maze of other vehicles, near a thousand yards away,
neither of the costers seemed to find it worth while
to look back.
</P>

<P>
I closed the window, and sitting down beside the
coffin, laughed until my sides ached. Once again
I had crossed swords with Sir Charles Venner, and
once again the victory was mine. I did not respect
him the less, but I admit that I glorified myself the
more. I could not, however, afford much time for
self-gratulation. I had a great deal to do, and it was
already two o'clock. Stepping into the passage, I
shouted for the landlady, and made that astonished
woman a present of my coffin. It is evident that
she thought me a lunatic, but what cared I for that?
In another moment I was hasting down the road,
looking on all sides for a cab. An empty fourwheeler
overtook me at last, and I drove like mad to London
Bridge, where I took a hansom to Bruton Street. I
was very hungry by then, but I could not spare a
minute for a meal, and I comforted myself with the
reflection that, granted a little luck, I might dine
that evening in absolute security on the fat of the
land, a rich man in veritable deed.
</P>

<P>
I had once known rather intimately a Polish Jew
named Kutnewsky, who had been my fellow lodger
in a boarding-house at Leeds. Him I resolved to
personate. He was a fat, podgy person, with a hook
nose, and a long, thick black beard, and his voice
was oily, his foreign accent hideous. All the while I
dressed, I practised his voice and accent. I had it
at last to a T. The wonderful development of my
facial muscles enabled me to raise or depress the tip
of my nose at will, so as to lend it either a pug, or a
Judaic cast, as I preferred. A false wig and beard
with clothes in keeping completed my disguise. I
was very soon a Jew&mdash;in fact, the double of Kutnewsky.
I then packed a small valise with a complete
suit of fashionable clothes, which had been originally
made for a man of my size, by a Bond Street tailor,
and which were still almost brand new, although I
had bought them at a rag shop for a song. I included
also in my bag, a travelling cap, a white shirt,
a doubled linen collar, a smart tie, and a pair of light
patent leather boots. The boots I wore were heavy
hand-sewn bluchers, two sizes too large for me. I
slipped into my pocket a black moustache and a pair
of large black eyebrows. Finally, I exchanged my
ordinary set of false teeth for a plate planted with
hideous yellow fangs, some of which protruded from
my lip. At a quarter to four, I was ready to face
the world. A glance at the window showed me that
a fine rain was falling; I therefore put on a mackintosh,
and cramming a glossy silk hat upon my head,
I set out armed with my valise and an umbrella.
A fourwheeler took me to Oxford Circus, whence a
hansom brought me back to Piccadilly and the Bolingbroke
Hotel. I presented myself to the clerk,
whom I informed in execrable broken English, that
I was the famous German Court Surgeon, Herr Dr.
Garschagen, just arrived from Berlin, to confer with
my equally eminent colleague, Sir Charles Venner,
upon a case of great moment, in which my advice
had been urgently demanded. I declared that I had
telegraphed from Berlin to secure apartments on
the first floor, and I became very angry when the
clerk protested that my message had not been
received, and that there was not a single vacant
apartment on the first floor. He, however, very
deferentially led me himself to a room on the third
floor, which I reluctantly engaged. I told him to send
Sir Charles up immediately he arrived, and with a
foreign boorishness I slammed the door in his face.
My first act was to empty my valise and conceal
its contents in a wardrobe. That effected, I arranged
the dressing-table just as I had done on the
previous day in my room at the Colonnade Hotel,
and I set my empty valise thereon. I then removed
my waterproof, and putting on a pair of goggles, I
sat down to await my victim. As before he was
prompt to the fraction of a minute. A small thin-featured
waiter ushered him in. As before Sir
Charles gave his attendant a shilling and entered the
room; I, grinding out the while, a string of guttural,
yet oily greetings in broken English. Sir Charles
Venner's face was pale, but icily composed. He eyed
me for a full minute with a look of piercing hate,
then, taking off his hat, he quietly sat down upon
the chair I had provided. I followed his example.
</P>

<P>
"Is Dr. Rudolf Garschagen identical with Mr.
Seth Halford?" he asked quietly.
</P>

<P>
"Undoubtedly, Sir Charles."
</P>

<P>
"I stood in need of your assurance!" he muttered
frowning. "But I confess I should like you to
explain the meaning of your present mummery.
You were excellently well disguised before!"
</P>

<P>
I bowed profoundly. "Thank you for the compliment,
Sir Charles. I shall explain with pleasure.
It is my custom to change my appearance as often
as my clothes. The wisdom of this course will be
apparent to you, when you consider that you have
already confessed to a confused impression of me
in your mind!"
</P>

<P>
His frown grew more black. "You appear to be
a confoundedly clever fellow!" he exclaimed in
irritated tones.
</P>

<P>
"I entertain such a lively respect for my opponent
that I have tried to show you my best!" I replied,
laying a gloved hand on my heart.
</P>

<P>
"I did not come here to exchange compliments
with you," he retorted coldly. "Kindly get to
business."
</P>

<P>
"Have you the money?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Yes. But I shall not give you a solitary farthing
until I am furnished with a substantial guarantee
that this will be your last impertinence. My&mdash;er&mdash;friends
and I do not propose to let you hold our souls
in pawn."
</P>

<P>
"What guarantee do you require?"
</P>

<P>
He took a paper from his packet and tossed it
carelessly upon the table. "Read!" said he.
</P>

<P>
The paper contained a confession that I&mdash;a blank
was left for my name&mdash;on a certain night, stole from
Sir Charles Venner, by means of impersonation and
fraud, the sum of three hundred pounds.
</P>

<P>
"I suppose you wish me to sign this?" I
asked.
</P>

<P>
"Certainly, and to disclose your identity besides!"
</P>

<P>
I smiled grimly and tore the paper into shreds.
</P>

<P>
"You must be satisfied with my oath, which I give
you freely, that you will never hear from me again,
Sir Charles. Now, please, the money."
</P>

<P>
"I am sorry," he said softly. "But we cannot
do business on those terms!"
</P>

<P>
I bowed and got at once to my feet. "Then our
interview is at an end!" I moved towards the bell,
but I had not advanced two paces when he cried out,
"Stop!"
</P>

<P>
I turned to look into the muzzle of a revolver.
Sir Charles Venner's right eye gleamed behind the
sights, and his expression was diabolically wicked.
I hate fire-arms. They make me nervous, especially
when pointed in the direction of my vital organs,
by a presumably desperate man. A cold shivering
thrill quivered up my spine, and I felt my knee
joints loosen. My eyes, however, did not cease to
serve me, and with a gasp of reviving hope I noted
that the pistol was not cocked. It, however, takes
more than a second to recover from such a shock as I
had received, and Sir Charles had only perceived
my first sharp gush of fear.
</P>

<P>
"Remove your glasses and your wig!" he commanded
in a low but terrible voice.
</P>

<P>
My impulse was to obey unhesitatingly, but with
an iron effort I subdued it.
</P>

<P>
"Be quick!" he cried.
</P>

<P>
I smiled. It was a miserable grimace, I dare admit,
nevertheless I smiled.
</P>

<P>
"By the God above us you will die in your tracks,
unless you are unmasked before I count six!"
</P>

<P>
I said to myself&mdash;"Oh, no, I shall not. Sir Charles
Venner is a consumptive, with at most a year of life
before him. Men cling to life most dearly when their
days are numbered. Moreover, well he knows, this
surgeon, that if he kills me he must hang! and
speedily."
</P>

<P>
"One!" said he.
</P>

<P>
I smiled again.
</P>

<P>
"Two!"
</P>

<P>
"You are a great mathematician!" I sneered,
and bowed to him.
</P>

<P>
"Three!"
</P>

<P>
"Murder me some other time, Sir Charles!" I
muttered, "when you may do so with some hope
of giving the penalty leg bail!"
</P>

<P>
"Four!" he cried, in a voice that froze my blood.
And with his thumb he raised the hammer of the
pistol.
</P>

<P>
"You will hang!" I gasped. "You will hang,
and we shall meet in Hell!"
</P>

<P>
"Five!" he hissed.
</P>

<P>
"Fire!" I cried. It was the most courageous
act of my life!
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner let his hand fall, and his eyes.
I heard a click, and I watched him restore the pistol
to his pocket. In one second he had aged ten years.
He was now an old man, haggard faced and trembling.
</P>

<P>
I strode to the bell and pressed the button. I had
won the battle well&mdash;woe to the vanquished! I
stalked over to the door and threw it wide. "Get
out of this!" I grated. "Get out of this and go&mdash;hang
yourself if you want to cheat the hangman.
You've had your fun, and now by heaven! I'll have
my pound of flesh!"
</P>

<P>
He raised to me the face of a panic-stricken craven.
"For Christ's sake!" he cried, and even pleaded
with his hands. He was beaten indeed. Not only
his courage, but his pride was shattered into fragments.
I surveyed the wreck I had occasioned,
and relented.
</P>

<P>
"Well, then!" I said, "the money!"
</P>

<P>
With feverish hands he tore from his coat a small
bundle of notes and forced them upon me.
</P>

<P>
"Count them, count them!" he mumbled.
</P>

<P>
"Go!" I ordered sternly.
</P>

<P>
"But, but&mdash;your oath!"
</P>

<P>
"I'll keep it&mdash;go!"
</P>

<P>
He uttered a hollow groan, and rushed out of the
room.
</P>

<P>
I looked at the notes. They were brand new, and
ten in number. Each represented one thousand
pounds. Hearing footfalls I concealed them, and a
second later, there came to me the small thin-faced
waiter who had conducted Sir Charles to my apartment.
</P>

<P>
I gave him a florin, and said. "I want a man,
big&mdash;my own size&mdash;just like me&mdash;to carry a box.
You are too small. Send me a man like I want at
once, but he must belong to your hotel, I can trust
no strangers!"
</P>

<P>
The fellow bowed and promised, and hurried off.
I put on my hat, and as soon as he had disappeared,
I followed him. A gentleman stood by the elevator
door, as though waiting for it to ascend. I passed
him, and began to descend the stairs. He immediately
rang the bell three times. Was that a signal,
I wondered. I returned very quickly, but he still
stood there, and he did not seem to be aware of my
existence. But he rang the bell <i>once</i>. I again began
to descend the stairs. Again the bell rang three
times. I came to the lower floor, and there another
gentleman was standing before the elevator door.
I passed him and he rang the bell twice. "How
curious!" thought I, "my room is on the third
floor of the hotel. There the bell was thrice rung;
but on the second floor only twice, and most remarkable
coincidence of all, the elevator does not trouble
to appear!" I had left the second floor&mdash;I returned
to it! The waiting gentleman rang once! I was
satisfied. "Sir Charles Venner," said I, "has put
at least three detectives on my trail!"
</P>

<P>
I marched straight up to the elevator door and
rang the bell myself&mdash;one long continued ring. It
appeared at once. "Ze third floor!" I muttered
to the attendant. "Ich haf forgotten zomding!"
I gave the man a shilling, and a moment later I was
back in my room with the door shut. I began to
undress, and when the knock that I expected
sounded, I stood in my socks and underclothes alone.
</P>

<P>
"Come in," I cried.
</P>

<P>
A burly red face waiter entered. He wore a
short black beard at the sight of which I rejoiced.
"Shut the door!" said I. He obeyed.
</P>

<P>
"Mein friendt!" said I, looking at him very
keenly, "do you vish to earn a sovereign?"
</P>

<P>
"Rather!" he cried.
</P>

<P>
"Then vill you go a message for me!"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"You see dose boots." I pointed to the pair I
had removed.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Take off your own and put on dose. You are
going to valk through some mud, and as it rains I
do not vish you to catch cold. They will fit you!"
I added, for he seemed to hesitate. He looked extremely
astonished, but he sat down and did my
bidding. I smiled upon him very genially. "If
you do well, I shall double your reward!" I said.
"What is your name, my man!"
</P>

<P>
"Clint, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Very good, Clint. Now I vant you to leaf zis
hotel without any von knowing dat you go! I tell
you vy ven you come back. Here, take zis
zovereign."
</P>

<P>
He took it, but he frowned. "I'd get into a row,
sir, if it was known," he muttered doubtfully.
</P>

<P>
I gave him another sovereign. "Don't you vorry
apout dot row," said I. "I fix you wit your boss.
I not vant you to do nozzing wrong, my boy, hein?"
</P>

<P>
"No, sir, of course not!" He looked much happier.
</P>

<P>
"Zen put on zis waterproof of mine, so. Button
it opp to ze chin. Ach, Himmel, zat is goot! Now
mein friend, zis cap, so! button ze flap under ze
chin! So, sehr goot, your mutter not know you now,
hein!"
</P>

<P>
He looked in the glass and laughed aloud at his
reflection. I took off my goggles and handed them
to him. "Put on dose!" I said, "und dat is all!"
</P>

<P>
He obeyed me, and I almost shouted out in my
delight, he looked so very like a man disguised.
</P>

<P>
"Now mein friendt, you can go!" said I.
</P>

<P>
"Where to, sir?" he enquired.
</P>

<P>
I gave him a handful of silver. "You take a
cab," I began, "and you drive to ze Marble Arch,
zere you get out, und you take a 'bus to Cricklewood,
you mind dat?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Vell, ven you come to ze Cricklewood terminus,
you find a man zere vaiting for you&mdash;a big Sherman
gentleman, like me. You say to him: "Doctor!"
und he vill take you at once across a hill to his house,
und he give you a small box! You bring that box
back to me quick, und take care not to lose it&mdash;for
it is vorth much geld&mdash;zat is money. You know
now what you do? Hein?"
</P>

<P>
He assured me that he understood, and would
follow my instructions to the letter, whereupon I
dismissed him to his fate. In another moment I
had changed my fang teeth for a more fashionable
set, and ten minutes later I slipped out of the passage,
locking my door behind me, as smart a dude
as ever stepped from a Bond Street band-box. My
facial disguise consisted of a monocle, a dark wig,
black eyebrows, and a sweet little silky black moustache.
I walked with mincing steps, and I screwed
up my features till they looked as vacuous and expressionless
as possible. I found on turning the
corner that a gentleman, whose figure I recognized,
was standing before the elevator door. For a second
I went cold. "Had my decoy then failed of its
purpose?" I asked myself. In a fever of anxiety
I began to descend the stairs, straining my ears to
listen. No signal bell rang&mdash;but I heard swift footfalls
in the passage. In a flash I understood. Two
of my three shadowers had followed the waiter,
Clint, but the third had remained behind to watch
my room. He would certainly be furnished with a
master key, and within a minute, he would open my
door and discover my escape. Moreover, he would
know for certain whom he must thenceforth follow,
for he had given me a sharp look as I passed him.
</P>

<P>
Instead of hurrying, however, I walked more
leisurely than before. Three spies would have been
too much for me, but one I did not care for. I felt
confident I would elude him as soon as I pleased.
As it transpired we reached the ground floor almost
together, for he descended in the elevator. I took a
good look at him, and marched to the street door.
Beckoning to a porter, I directed him in mealy tones
to fetch me a hansom. One stood already by the
kerb, but instinct told me that it belonged to my
spy. The porter blew his whistle, and a second
hansom soon appeared. I threw the porter half a
crown and sprang aboard. "Streeters', Bond
Street!" I cried, and we were off. My mission was
to dispose of my bank-notes; for well I knew that
their numbers would be noted, and that the longer
they remained in my possession the more certainly
would they provide a clue to the ultimate establishment
of my identity. On the other hand, to pay
them into my bank would have been equivalent to
making a present of my secret to my enemy. I
would, it is true, lose something by the exchange,
but I could well afford to pay handsomely for my
security. My shadower followed me so closely,
that I perceived he was no longer anxious to conceal
his occupation. We alighted from our cabs within
ten paces of each other, and he trod upon my heels
as I entered the great jewellers. I had a mind to
turn and offer him my arm. I bought two magnificent
necklaces, and a long string of splendid
brilliants under his very nose, paying therefore my
£10,000, and receiving two hundred pounds in
change. I then purchased a little brooch for twenty
guineas. As we left the shop, I nodded kindly to my
shadower, and advised him in an underbreath to be
careful. He made no reply, but he gritted his teeth
together in the manner of a bull-dog. He looked
rather like a bull-dog too, in other respects. He had
a long forehead, great heavy jaws, and little watchful
eyes. The clocks were striking a quarter to six as
we resumed our hansoms. I drove to the Alhambra
Music Hall and purchased a stall. I then proceeded
to Verrey's restaurant and ordered a first-rate dinner.
My spy took a seat at my table without asking my
permission, and we gazed at each other steadily
while we discussed the meal. But while I ate roast
pheasant, he partook of beef, and while I drank
sparkling Burgundy, he absorbed a quart of bitter
beer. I would have engaged him in conversation,
for I am of a sociable disposition, and I bore him no
ill-will, but the fact is, he was an extremely vulgar
fellow, and if I had not been simply ravenous, his
table manners must infallibly have destroyed my
appetite. When I could eat no more, I bought from
my waiter a sheet of note-paper, an envelope, and a
lead pencil. I then smoked a cigar, and when eight
struck, I drove to the theatre. My shadower secured
a seat three rows behind me. I studied the
programme, and discovered that the second succeeding
item was to be a song dance performed by a
lady named Pearl Glynn. I had never heard of her,
but I know her class as well as any man that lives.
Taking out my pencil and paper, I scratched the
following epistle: "Dear Miss Glynn,&mdash;A humble
adorer begs you to accept the enclosed, and to grant
him a moment's interview, before your turn." I
slipped this into the envelope together with the
brooch I had bought at Streeters' for twenty
guineas; I addressed it and beckoned to an usher.
I gave it to him together with a wink and half a
sovereign. He returned in ten minutes and begged
me to follow him. I got up and glanced at my spy.
He also got up, looking horribly uneasy. But I
knew the theatre and he did not. I fancied I could
hear him gnash his teeth, in impotent rage, to see his
quarry escaping under his nose. As I approached
the wing door leading to the stage and dressing
rooms with my conductor, I took care not to lose
sight of him. Oblivious of the comfort of those who
obstructed him, he was toilfully climbing over empty
fauteuils, or squeezing his way between rows of
people in my wake. I feel sure that many of his
victims thought him mad, but I heartily admired
him for his energy and perseverance, and just before
the door closed behind me, and upon him, I turned
and kissed my hand to him in token of appreciation.
I knew well what he would do. Finding he could
not pass the door, he would turn and rush out of the
theatre to wait for me at the stage-door in the other
street. I stopped dead and addressed the usher.
</P>

<P>
"My man," said I, "I have changed my mind.
I'll go back."
</P>

<P>
He shrugged his shoulders. "Just as you like,
sir," he replied.
</P>

<P>
In fact, we immediately returned into the auditorium,
and two minutes later, I had traversed the
promenade, descended the stairs, and was running
like a hare across Leicester Square; alone, alone!
</P>

<P>
A cab took me to Bruton Street, and nine o'clock
had barely struck when I was once again plain
Brown, Sir William Dagmar's discreet and faithful
valet.
</P>

<P>
I have never been intoxicated in my life, but it is
often wise to assume a virtue, though you have it not,
as the old proverb advises.
</P>

<P>
It seemed good to me to be drunk just then, and
better still, the nearer I approached my master's
house. As I mounted the steps I reeled. It cost
me eighty seconds of painful effort to find the keyhole.
I did not, as it happens, use it even when
found, for the door opened suddenly, and I staggered
forward into Sir Charles Venner's arms. I had
expected him to confront me, nevertheless, it shocked
me to find my expectations realized, and to be convinced
how tenaciously he had clung to his first suspicions.
I picked myself up and stood before him,
a swaying, blinking maudlin figure. With much
circumstance and drunken gravity, I explained to
him that I had buried my mother, and that to steady
my nerves I had taken afterwards a single glass of
wine, which must surely have been drugged. Sir
Charles treated me as tenderly as any woman could
have done. He pretended to believe my story, and
he protested that the rascally landlord, who had
drugged me, deserved richly to be prosecuted. He
guided me to my bed-room, and assisted me to bed.
He then declared that he would prepare me a reviving
draught, and taking a tumbler from my dressing-table,
he dissolved with water a couple of tiny white
pillules, which mixture he persuaded me to drink.
I knew his purpose, of course. He wished to search
me. But I was in no wise alarmed nor unwilling,
for I had left everything I possessed at Bruton Street,
and my pockets contained only my keys, and half a
handful of loose silver. Saying to myself: "Morphia!"
I swallowed the draught, and even drained
the glass. Within five minutes I was sleeping like
the dead, whereupon Sir Charles Venner searched
to his heart's content, poor man.

A DREAM OF LOVE
</H4>

<P>
I awoke with a racking headache and an uneasy
sensation that I had overslept myself. I
sprang up and dipped my head into a basin of ice-cold
water. That tranquillized the pain I suffered,
yet my uneasiness continued, nay, it became intensified
when I glanced at my watch, and saw that it
was after nine o'clock. Very hastily I began to
dress, but ere I came to my collar I paused and reflected.
I am not a particularly introspective man,
nor more than a skin-deep psychologist, but it was
not a difficult thing to trace to its source the cause
of my uneasiness. It patently derived its origin
from the habits of servitude to which I had submitted
myself during the last three months. There
suddenly occurred to me to ask myself this question:
"Agar Hume, how long will you permit such
habits to persist?" I answered at once: "Why,
a day or two, at most!"
</P>

<P>
The fact is, I was a rich man, and the pride of
purse, the first pride I had ever experienced, was
beginning to swell my head already.
</P>

<P>
In my room at Bruton Street I had almost five
hundred pounds in cash, as well as jewels for which
I had last night paid £9,800. I possessed, moreover,
a credit balance at my bank of exactly one hundred
and forty-two pounds. I considered therefore that
it would be absurd for me to continue playing the
lackey to my master for a beggarly eight pounds
per month, when a sufficient capital was ready to
my hands, with which, and one or two smiles of the
fickle goddess, I could make myself a millionaire.
I forthwith determined to quit Sir William Dagmar's
service as soon as possible. Yes; that very morning
I would leave! Why linger, when every day
now spent in Curzon Street postponed my advancement
in life, and perhaps wasted opportunities for
self-aggrandisement that might never return. Such
a course would certainly awaken and fortify Sir
Charles Venner's suspicions, but what cared I for
that. He could prove nothing against me, and,
besides, I would soon be utterly beyond his reach.
It was my idea to go to France; there realize upon
my jewels, and with the proceeds speculate upon the
Bourse. If I won, well and good! If I lost, also
well and good, there was always England and the
blackmailing business to fall back upon! My only
regret in departing was contained in this fact.
Although I had met with marvellous success in
exploring the secrets of my master's ghastly society
of consumptives, I had by no means plumbed all
its depths. The mystery of the monthly dicing by
the members for the £7,000 cheque was still unexplained,
and I could not think of it without
tasting something of the torture that afflicted
Tantalus. It was not only curiosity that plagued
me. I am a good workman and, like every other
really conscientious artisan, it distresses me to see
a job blotched or scamped for the lack of a little
skill or perseverance. For that reason in particular
I hated the thought of leaving any part of the task
which I had set myself to perform unfinished.
Nevertheless, I felt that I should be standing in
my own light if I allowed personal vanity to prevent
me from seizing the earliest opportunity to
improve my fortunes.
</P>

<P>
"Yes; I'll go!" said I aloud at last; and I
leisurely completed my toilet. I then packed into
a bag my few belongings, and proceeded noiselessly
downstairs, resolved to enjoy a last breakfast at my
master's expense, and thereafter bid the place a
long farewell. The house was very silent. Sir
William's door was shut, and no one appeared to be
awake. So much the better, thought I, and having
arrived upon the ground floor, I pushed open the
pantry door and entered.
</P>

<P>
To my surprise, Nurse Hargreaves was standing
before the table, with her back to me, doing something;
but what, I could not see. She had not
heard my approach, that was evident, for she did
not turn her head. The stove was ablaze and the
kettle was merrily singing. Perhaps its song had
drowned my footfalls.
</P>

<P>
"Making a poultice, nurse?" I asked, stepping
forward.
</P>

<P>
She started at my voice and turned. I uttered a
little cry, then with a curious heart thrill I caught
my breath and paused, transfixed, overwhelmed!
I looked not at Nurse Hargreaves, but into the eyes
of Marion Le Mar.
</P>

<P>
"Ah!" she murmured, "you thought I was
Nurse Hargreaves?"
</P>

<P>
"My name is Le Mar!" she went on, turning
calmly to her work again. "Nurse Hargreaves has
gone to another case. I have taken her place!"
</P>

<P>
She was just as beautiful, nay, rather more beautiful
than ever, in spite of her expression of deep
melancholy and the dark sleepless hollows that
undercast her eyes. I watched her&mdash;dumbstricken,
but with all my heart in the looks with which I
worshipped her&mdash;and through the while I gladly
wondered how for one instant I could have forgotten
that incomparable woman. I had forgotten
her! I had coldly purposed to leave England and
her. But already that resolve was dead and buried.
Not even to make myself a millionaire could I
forego the rapture I discovered in gazing on her
face; and to remain now, meant that I should
dwell under the same roof!
</P>

<P>
I forgot my life governing maxim at that moment:
"First person paramount!" I was the slave of a
woman, who had never seen me in my proper person
until then, and who seeing me at last had turned
carelessly away, after one swift unlingering regard.
It was a galling thought, but it possessed no influence
except to wound. I loved her and I knew
it. I knew besides that her heart was buried in a
dead man's grave. And yet I, the most selfish
wretch alive, there and then bowed my head to fate,
and in sad humility determined to sacrifice my
fortunes to the uncertain chance of serving her and
the sure bliss of seeing her and breathing the air
she breathed.
</P>

<P>
Life is a very marvellous affair, and so too is love.
I have never professed to understand either. Therefore
I shall make no pretence to explain nor even
speculate upon my strange experience. I shall
merely relate what passed as best I may.
</P>

<P>
Marion's interest in her occupation was sincere,
but it did not prevent her mentally remarking on
my silence. I saw her brows contract at length,
and soon afterwards she spoke, but without looking
up.
</P>

<P>
"You are Brown, I suppose?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;at&mdash;at least," I stammered, "that is how
Sir William Dagmar calls me."
</P>

<P>
"Indeed! What then is your name?"
</P>

<P>
"Agar Hume, madam."
</P>

<P>
She gave me a glance of nascent curiosity, and
asked me to pour some boiling water in a bowl. I
complied, and she prepared to leave the room. Her
poultice was made.
</P>

<P>
"Pardon me," I said. "How is Sir William this
morning?"
</P>

<P>
"Still very low, although sensible. His crisis is
past, however, and Sir Charles Venner feels confident
he will recover."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you!" I bowed gravely. "Permit me,
madam, to relieve you of that burden."
</P>

<P>
"Please do not trouble."
</P>

<P>
"Madam, pardon me, but I insist!"
</P>

<P>
She raised her eyebrows, but she gave me the
bowl. I read her thoughts; they said: "This valet
has borrowed manners from his master. He might
almost pass for a gentleman."
</P>

<P>
My cheeks burned. I followed her upstairs and
into my master's room.
</P>

<P>
Sir William Dagmar was awake. He looked a
mere skeleton, and his transparent face was as white
as the coverlid.
</P>

<P>
He greeted me with a wan smile and a hoarse
whisper: "It is good to see you again, Brown," he
muttered. "It proves to me that I am on the
mend."
</P>

<P>
I took his feeble hand and pressed it gently. At
the bottom of my heart I really liked the man.
"You must make haste and get well, sir," I said
softly. "The world grows impatient for your
book."
</P>

<P>
Ah! vanity! Sir William's cheeks flushed, and
a warm light flashed into his deep thoughtful eyes.
"I'll not keep it waiting a minute longer than I can
help!" he cried. But at that Marion stepped forward
and compelled me from the room.
</P>

<P>
It was a keen pleasure to prepare her breakfast.
I gave her the things that I myself liked best, and
half an hour later it fed my vanity to watch her
eat. I waited upon her, but she did not speak to
me throughout the meal. Nurse Hargreaves had
once insisted upon my sitting down with her to
table. But somehow I preferred to serve Marion
as a flunkey, rather than dine with any other woman
in the world.
</P>

<P>
Presently she gave me instance of her spirit. Mr.
Sefton Dagmar entered the room when she had
almost finished.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, Brown!" said he, "I'm late as usual.
Good morning, Miss Le Mar; you are looking rather
pale. Did the old buck give you a bad night?"
</P>

<P>
The vacuous puppy! Marion blushed and her
eyes glittered.
</P>

<P>
"Do you refer to your uncle?" she asked in
freezing tones.
</P>

<P>
"Well, now," he replied with a leer of admiration,
"who else would you suppose? Much better have
taken my tip and gone with me to a music-hall, my
dear. You are too doocid pretty a girl to be tied
up by a sick bed. Waste of charms, and all that
sort of thing."
</P>

<P>
Marion arose from her chair, and with a curling
lip, swept out of the room. I darted forward to
open the door for her, but she passed me in disdain,
without a glance. Mr. Sefton Dagmar laughed loud
and long. But I was mad with him, and malice
prompted me to cut his laughter short.
</P>

<P>
"Sir," said I, "have you seen Sir William this
morning?"
</P>

<P>
"No!" he cried, "have you?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;he has rounded the corner. He is sensible
again, and Sir Charles Venner declares that he is on
the high road to recovery!"
</P>

<P>
"Hell and curses!" gasped Mr. Dagmar. "Is
that true?"
</P>

<P>
"Too true!" I heaved a sigh, but in truth his
despairing rage had thoroughly delighted me. He
had insulted Marion.
</P>

<P>
"What in blazes am I to do?" he muttered,
pushing his plate aside with savage gesture. His
appetite had incontinently vanished.
</P>

<P>
"If I were you, sir," I ventured gently, "I should
return at once to Newhaven. If your uncle knew
you were here, who knows what he might say?"
</P>

<P>
"Be damned if I do!" he snapped. "It may be
only a flash in the pan. Curse me, if I don't go up
and have a look at the old boy myself."
</P>

<P>
I began to protest at once, but he hurled an oath
at my head and rushed out. Desperation had lent
him a rat's courage. I followed quickly, but he was
already in the sick-room before I reached the door.
There I paused and silently surveyed the scene.
Marion, as though conscious that her patient would
dislike to see his visitor, had swiftly interposed herself
between Mr. Sefton and the bed, and by signs
she now forbade the young man to advance.
</P>

<P>
Sir William was asleep.
</P>

<P>
"Kindly stand aside," muttered Mr. Sefton
Dagmar; "I intend to see my uncle, and you won't
prevent me!"
</P>

<P>
"Another time," whispered Marion, whose eyes
were simply ablaze. "You cannot see him now;
he is asleep!"
</P>

<P>
What wild fancy possessed the young man I do
not know. Perhaps the fool imagined that his uncle
was dead, and that for some base, esoteric purpose
Marion wished to hide his death. At all events, he
suddenly stepped forward and thrust her brutally
aside.
</P>

<P>
The noise of that scuffle, slight as it was, awakened
the sick man. His eyes opened and he looked up
to gaze upon his nephew's rage-distorted visage.
"You here!" he gasped.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sefton Dagmar turned grey. "I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;hope&mdash;I
hope you're feeling better, sir!" he stammered.
</P>

<P>
"Why are&mdash;you&mdash;in London?" whispered Sir
William.
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;your illness, sir."
</P>

<P>
"When did you come up?"
</P>

<P>
"Last night, sir," lied the nephew.
</P>

<P>
The uncle closed his eyes, and appeared to reflect.
A moment passed and then very silently he opened
them again. "Marion!" he said.
</P>

<P>
She stepped to his side. She still seemed greatly
agitated.
</P>

<P>
"Make him go!" whispered the sick man very
faintly. "Make him leave my house at once. Tell
Brown!"
</P>

<P>
The words died in a sigh. He closed his eyes
once more and to all appearances he slept.
</P>

<P>
Marion turned to Mr. Sefton Dagmar with the
imperial manner of a queen.
</P>

<P>
"You heard, sir!" she said coldly.
</P>

<P>
The young man for a moment made no reply;
then he broke into a snarling stream of words.
</P>

<P>
"I see how it is," he hissed. "You are using
your infernal prettiness to cheat me out of my inheritance.
I've heard of your sort before. 'Marion'
he called you&mdash;'Marion!' Perhaps you've wormed
a will out of him already. Perhaps you want to
marry him on his death bed! Oh! I know your
sort. Of course, you'd like to turn me out of the
place neck and crop; I might interfere with your
precious scheming, hey? But I'm not going to let
you fleece me. Not much. Here I am, and here I
stay! Do your damndest&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
What further insults the vulgar ruffian might have
heaped upon the beautiful woman he confronted I
cannot guess. But at that juncture Marion threw
me a glance of passionate entreaty, and my heart
leaped to answer her appeal.
</P>

<A NAME="P189"></A>

<P>
In another second I had him by the throat, and
in still another I had hurled him sheer across the
room and through the door. Before he could arise
I was at his throat again. No man was ever nearer
death than he, for I am physically strong, and at
that while I was fairly lunatic with passion.
</P>

<P>
It was Sir Charles Venner that saved his life. The
surgeon, who, it seems, had possessed himself some
time since of my master's latch-key, entered silently
in the midst of the fracas, and he pulled me from my
already black-faced prey.
</P>

<P>
I got to my feet, shaking like a leaf, and hardly
conscious where I was. My master's door was shut,
and Marion stood against it, her two great eyes
burning out of her sheet-white face. She too was
trembling violently.
</P>

<P>
"What is all this?" demanded Sir Charles, stirring
the insensible Sefton Dagmar with his foot.
</P>

<P>
"Brown is not to blame," muttered the girl.
"Sir William ordered him to make Mr. Dagmar
leave the house. He&mdash;he had forced his way into
the sick-room!" She gave me once more an appealing
glance, as though asking me to substantiate her
story. "That&mdash;that is all!" she concluded with a
sob.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Dagmar resisted me," I added quickly.
"He made a dreadful scene in the sick room. Upon
my soul, sir, I believe he wished to kill his uncle!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles nodded. "Not unlikely," he remarked
indifferently enough. "Carry the blackguard
downstairs, Brown. Now, Marion, by your
leave I'll see my patient."
</P>

<P>
They disappeared, and I, stooping, lifted young
Dagmar in my arms and carried him below. When
he recovered he gave me a look of murderous
malignity, got silently to his feet, and staggered to
his room. Ten minutes later he departed from the
house without sparing a word to me or any other
there. I was glad to see his back, for although I
bore him no ill-will, I had no longer any manner of
use for him.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner soon afterwards was good
enough to pay a visit to my pantry.
</P>

<P>
"Was that Mr. Dagmar who went out a while
ago?" he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, Sir Charles."
</P>

<P>
"Did he take his traps?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Don't admit him again, Brown. He has upset
your master very much. By the way, I am pleased
with you Brown; you acted very properly. You
need not repay me the money that I lent you, my
man. I wish you to keep it as a little present&mdash;from
me."
</P>

<P>
"Oh, sir!" I cried, "I could not think of doing
that. I shall always be indebted to you by the
memory of your kindness and glad to be, Sir Charles.
But you must let me pay you back the money."
</P>

<P>
"Well, well; I'm not sure but what I like you
the better for that spirit, Brown. Yet I think you
are a fool."
</P>

<P>
"It is the way I was made, sir," I murmured
apologetically. "Thank you kindly all the same."
</P>

<P>
He nodded and left. His suspicions were dead,
that was evident. I thought it very funny, but I
was less pleased than I might have been. My unwavering
run of success, God knows why, was
beginning to give me a Dead Sea flavour in the
mouth. Perhaps Marion had something to do with
it. Indeed, I could not drive her from my thoughts,
except to con my own rascality. Whereon this
wonder speedily arose: what would she think of me
if she could know?
</P>

<P>
At about eleven o'clock she appeared in the door
armed with her inevitable bowl. "I must make
another poultice!" she announced.
</P>

<P>
I begged her to take a seat and direct me. She
was so weary that it was easy to persuade her. And
thus I entered upon her service and became a nurse.
</P>

<P>
She spoke never a word of that which had happened
over stairs, but I thought I detected in her
bearing a growing, if melancholy, tolerance, and perhaps
some small faint trace of interest in myself.
At any rate, she watched me at her work, and that
was something benedictive to my mind. Silent was
her mood, however, and silence suited her. It ever
seemed a pity that speech should be allowed to mar
the perfect calm of her reposeful countenance&mdash;until
she spoke&mdash;when instantly one lost regret in wonder
at the new and unexpected graces so called into
existence.
</P>

<P>
During the next few days the world dealt kindly
with our household. Sir William's strength very
gradually improved; Marion relaxed a little of her
habitual sadness, and as for me, I had never been
so happy in my life. I only left the house on one
occasion, in order to convey my valuables from
Bruton Street to the bank. After that was done,
I felt minded never to quit Curzon Street again so
long as our then manner of living might continue.
I spent my time between the sick room and the
pantry; relieving Marion of every trouble that I
could, and waiting on her with the noiseless patience
of a shadow. In this I was wise, without other intention
than to please her. My silence began to
appeal to her imagination even more than my ceaseless
studied courtesies. And in this behalf I would
remark my faith that no woman lives, howso preoccupied
with grief or other interests, who can long
remain impervious to persistently considerate devotion.
I often caught her watching me with grave,
inquiring eyes. On such occasions it was I, not she,
who exhibited confusion. I could not act to her.
Sometimes feeling her power I grew quite terrified.
Did she study me? I wondered, and what was her
opinion? I was soon to know.
</P>

<P>
One evening Sir William dropped into a deep
slumber far sooner than his wont. The room adjoining
his I had converted from a dressing-chamber
into a boudoir for Marion's convenience; and there
she had become accustomed to retire, when circumstances
permitted, to rest and dream perhaps,
within his call. There it was I found her, replying
to the summons of her bell.
</P>

<P>
"You rang, madam?" I asked in a low voice.
She was reclining in a lounge. She had discarded
her nurse's costume for a wrapper, and she looked
the better for it; more softly lovely and more
human, too, I think.
</P>

<P>
She pointed to a chair. "Will you not talk to
me a while?" she asked. "I feel lonely to-night."
</P>

<P>
I felt my face burn as I bowed and sat down&mdash;upon
her bidding. I could hardly credit my good
fortune, and I lacked breath to reply.
</P>

<P>
"You have been very good to me," she murmured.
"Why was it, Brown?"
</P>

<P>
Still I could not reply. I dared not even look
at her.
</P>

<P>
She did not, however, appear to notice my confusion,
or else my eyes played false. Her voice was
just as even as it wandered on at the impulse of her
rambling fancy, as I thought.
</P>

<P>
"I have been thinking, Brown, that you were not
born a servant," she said quietly. "Will you tell
me if I guessed aright?"
</P>

<P>
No prescience warned me of a snare. Had any
other woman asked me such a question I should
have smiled and lied, knowing well that woman's
deepest policy is to persuade with flatteries. But
Marion questioned, and I answered from my heart.
</P>

<P>
"My father was a gentleman by birth, madam."
</P>

<P>
"Ah!" she sighed. "He met with some unhappiness,
no doubt?"
</P>

<P>
"He lies in a pauper's grave. He was a great
musician."
</P>

<P>
"And have you inherited his talent?"
</P>

<P>
"I play the flute and violin indifferently well,
madam."
</P>

<P>
"And you are educated too, for I have marked
your speech?"
</P>

<P>
"My father did his best for me, madam, though
I was slow, I fear, to learn. He was the wisest man,
and yet the most unfortunate, whom I have ever
known."
</P>

<P>
"Some day I may ask you to give me his history."
</P>

<P>
She sighed again, and for a time was silent, but at
length she fixed her eyes upon my face and said:
"You have a foreign 'air,' monsieur; I, who am
French, as you certainly must have guessed, have
marked it. Is it possible that your father was my
countryman?"
</P>

<P>
"He had not that honour, mademoiselle."
</P>

<P>
She gave a little frown. "And yet your name,
Hume&mdash;I think you said it might be French?"
</P>

<P>
"No, mademoiselle; but my mother was a
Parisienne. That will account to you perhaps for
the foreign 'air' you have marked in me."
</P>

<P>
She nodded her head, and half closing her eyes
she began in a low voice of melting sweetness to
hum to the tune of a famous little chansonette,
whose refrain is inexpressibly mournful and pathetic,
Maeterlinck's exquisite little poem, "Et s'il revenait
un jour!"
</P>

<P>
Knowing well the sadness in her which the sadness
of her song expressed, I felt my heart ache and
my eyes grew strangely blurred.
</P>

<P>
Of a sudden she stopped and, leaning forward,
gave me a look which seemed to reveal a longing
to be comforted.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, sir!" she said in French. "I see you have
a heart that might vibrate to woman's tears. And
yet you cannot know how sad I am, how very, very
miserable!"
</P>

<P>
And as she gazed at me her eyes overflowed with
two such tears as she had spoken of.
</P>

<P>
There are times when a passion of insensate anger
seizes me to look back upon my folly. Ah! woman's
wiles, woman's wiles! The greatest and the least
of us have been their victims. And who am I to
rave of my undoing, when a Sampson, a Nelson,
and even a Napoleon, that man of iron, shared my
fate.
</P>

<P>
But I was blind, blind! Pierced by the sight of
those tears to the very fibres of my being, I sprang
up, then falling on my knee before her, I seized and
passionately kissed her hand.
</P>

<P>
"Mademoiselle, you spoke justly," I cried in
French. "Here is a heart that only beats to serve
you, without seeking, ay, even without desiring a
reward, except that which you must give me of
your pleasure or without, when I shall see upon
your face some promise of your happiness repaired!"
</P>

<P>
The glance of involuntary horror that she gave
me, and the swift withdrawal of her hand from my
embrace, should have warned me of my fatuous self-betrayal.
But there is no limit to the errors of a
truly clever mind astray in seeking to retrieve itself.
I thought that I had angered her in venturing
to hint that her disease of sorrow might be cured.
</P>

<P>
"Pardon me," I pleaded earnestly, "I have
offended you with words. If any part of me could
so offend, that member I would straightaway
destroy."
</P>

<P>
She looked at me more kindly, and even now I
believe that she was touched by the sincerity and
singleness of my devotion.
</P>

<P>
"Rise, monsieur!" she murmured with an effort.
"I thank you for your sympathy, but it is not
seemly that you kneel to me."
</P>

<P>
I obeyed, and at her nod resumed my chair. She
closed her eyes, and for a long period was deathly
still. Her lovely face was extraordinarily pallid and
she scarcely seemed to breathe. Then I thought
her in the throes of reawakened grief for Cavanagh's
death, and my pain to watch her was intense. Now
I know that in her silence she was struggling with
herself. Or rather that pity in her, a woman's unfailing
pity for a loving being, however wretchedly
unworthy of compassion, was striving to silence her
ideas of duty.
</P>

<P>
At last her eyes opened and she looked at me.
Her regard was mysteriously wistful, cold, and it
seemed to me a little self-ashamed. Indeed, she
faintly blushed.
</P>

<P>
"Sir William Dagmar does not know that you
can speak French!" she murmured. "You have
deceived him, monsieur! That is wrong. I think
that you should go away."
</P>

<P>
Thrice triple fool I was. Her pity had cajoled
her conscience and she was offering me a chance to
escape. I, in my infatuation, only thought that
she chided me for my deceit.
</P>

<P>
"Ah! mademoiselle," I muttered. "It is true
that I deceived him, but when I did so I was penniless
and starving. I pray you from my soul that
you will not bid me leave you nor inform Sir William
Dagmar of my sin."
</P>

<P>
"You do not wish to go?"
</P>

<P>
"Mademoiselle!" I cried, "not though it were
to Paradise assured!"
</P>

<P>
She blushed deeply, nevertheless her eyes hardened
and she frowned. She was doubtless thinking&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"He has had his opportunity. His fate henceforth
must be upon his own head! I wash my
hands of it!"
</P>

<P>
I dreamed she was offended at my too ardent gaze.
I lowered my eyes at once in sad humility.
</P>

<P>
"Stay then!" she said, and her voice assumed a
tone of witching tenderness.
</P>

<P>
I looked up in quick delight to meet a dazzling
smile. With such a smile Judith lured Holofernes
to destruction. But it needed not that with me;
I was destroyed already.
</P>

<P>
"My friend," she said, and she extended me her
hand. "I thank you for your company, but, alas!
the hours speed, and I have much to do. Good
night!"
</P>

<P>
I tried to reply, but I could not. She permitted
me to kiss her hand, however, and even smiled again.
I left the room in a delirium of happiness, poor fool,
and not one of my enraptured dreams that night disclosed
to me the precipice upon whose brink I stood.
</P>

<P>
The days that followed were over full of strange,
untried experiences for me to properly describe them.
Marion was by my side whenever chance allowed.
But every hour she showed to me a different mood,
a varied and elusive distortion of her inmost self;
so that I came to wonder more and more whether I
knew truly aught of her except that she was beautiful
in all her moods, and that I loved her irretrievably.
One moment she was sad and steeped in cold unbending
gloom. The next she was a gay companion,
chattering of this and that as lightly and as brightly
as a bird on sunlit bough. Again she was both
grave and friendly at a time, and we conversed
together of men, and books, and serious philosophies
like two grey-haired, sober-minded savants. Sometimes,
yet more infrequently, she forced upon me
quarrels in caprice, to give her opportunity to scorch
me with her scorn. And yet, again, more rarely
still, she led me on with shy, alluring glances, or even
bolder looks, provocative of passion, to woo her as
I could; whereon, her will too readily achieved, she
swiftly changed from melting fire to ice, and I was
left in agonized confusion, swung like Mahommed's
coffin between despair and hope.
</P>

<P>
So another week elapsed, and a third began. My
master's life no longer stood in any danger, and his
health and strength slowly but steadily improved.
Sir Charles Venner still paid him daily visits, but
they were more to satisfy the claims of friendship
than of need. The great surgeon had always a
smile and kindly word for me. It seemed that his
suspicions had long ago been utterly eradicated,
and that a liking had usurped their place. Sometimes
I wondered if his penetrating insight had
remarked my love for Marion. But he was far too
profound an enigma for me to solve; and in any case
Marion engrossed my life and mind so utterly that I
had neither room nor inclination for any other
problem. A sort of madness had come over me.
Apart from her I dreamed; standing, sitting, or
reclining as the case might be, idle and immovable
as stone. I awoke to look upon her face, or listen
to her voice, on instant a creature of pulsating
passion; yet her humble and devoted slave, responding
to her slightest will, as swiftly and obediently
as a needle to the pole. And slowly but
surely hope grew stronger in my breast. A thin
wild hope it was at first, the veritable offspring of
despair. But fostered by my passion and her
wayward moods, it developed force and form, and
I could at last no more deny it place in my
imaginings. I hoped to win her. Yes; I hoped to
win her! There were times when I forgot the gulf
dug between us by her purity and my too criminal
unworthiness, and I remembered only that she was
a woman and I a man. The law of sex is hard to
supersede. It recognizes neither morals nor conventions.
It despises ethical distinctions, and it
laughs with love at every human effort to confine
its boundaries. At its command I began not only
to hope, but to aspire. One morning Marion came
to me and said: "Monsieur, Sir Charles Venner,
who has just departed, has ordered me to take a
holiday to-morrow. He says that I am looking
pale, and that I need a little open air and sunshine.
I think that he is wise, and I shall comply with his
command!"
</P>

<P>
"But," I stammered, for the thought of losing
her even for a day was a torture hardly to be borne,
"what of Sir William Dagmar? How will he get
on without you?"
</P>

<P>
"Sir Charles has promised to send another nurse
this evening, who will take my place."
</P>

<P>
"I trust, mademoiselle, that you&mdash;that you will
enjoy yourself," I muttered in a trembling voice.
"The house will be dull without you, though&mdash;for
me."
</P>

<P>
She gave me a swift, shy glance, then cast down
her eyes, folding and unfolding her hands before her.
</P>

<P>
"How could I enjoy myself&mdash;do you think&mdash;alone?"
she whispered. "It will be a sad day also
for me."
</P>

<P>
"Let me go with you," I blurted out. "I am
not needed here. Ah! I am mad to dream that
you would condescend so far. Forgive me of your
pity, and forget the insolence of my presumption!"
</P>

<P>
But she clapped her hands and laughed as blithely
as a child. "Will you come?" she cried. "But
that will be magnificent. Ah! let us see!" She
darted across the room and perched herself upon
the dresser. "Come here, monsieur, quite close to
me. Nay, not too close. So! Now we shall plan
our day. At sunrise we shall wake and dress, and
we shall have an early breakfast here, so as not to
waste a single moment of our day, our day!"
</P>

<P>
I gazed at her as a Peri might at Paradise, and she
rippled on.
</P>

<P>
"Afterwards we shall drive to the station, and
take a train to somewhere in the country, where we
may wander through green fields and flower-scattered
meadows, hand in hand like children. Shall
we not, monsieur?"
</P>

<P>
I nodded, lost in a perfect dreamland of delight.
</P>

<P>
"But, no!" she cried quite suddenly. "It is
beautiful, that picture, yet not so beautiful as this.
Listen, monsieur&mdash;but you can row a boat, of course."
</P>

<P>
I nodded again.
</P>

<P>
"Then, listen! We shall go by train to Hampton,
and there we shall take boat. The river is most
lovely thereabouts, and you shall slowly row me
up the stream towards Staines and Windsor through
the hottest hours; slowly, slowly past the green-lawned
banks and pretty houses, and among the
darling little osier islets. And as you row I'll sing.
And we'll forget our cares and open wide our hearts
to the sunshine and to happiness without an afterthought.
And when the noon comes we shall eat
our lunch upon an island; a merry interlude
between two golden dreams. For afterwards we'll
float upon our way again. And when the day is
done and twilight falls we shall land at the loveliest
place of all. I know it well. It is an old, old park
garden, thick planted with many great solemn trees.
A private park, but lonely, for the house is haunted,
so they say. And there I shall lead you by the
hand into a little marble, many pillared temple,
open to the stars, wherein a tiny spring is born
within a pool, a wishing well. And you shall look
therein and I, and we shall see fresh mirrored on its
surface&mdash;the faces of our loves. Shall we do all
this, monsieur?"
</P>

<P>
I could but bend my head, for her siren voice had
woven round my faculties a spell of charmed silence,
and not one of Circe's victims was ever more powerless
than I was then. When I looked up she had
gone. How I lived through that day and night I
scarcely know. I can in fact remember nothing
clearly of the hours that followed until the moment
came when I saw her seated before me in the boat,
the rudder lines slipping slowly through her folded
hands. It was early in the morning of an absolutely
perfect day. Of the river, the witching scenery, I
knew but noted little, for I looked only upon her
face. She was simply and yet elegantly clad in
some rich clinging stuff of purest white; her loveliness
it is beyond me to portray. But this I know&mdash;she
seemed to love me, and her mood was yielding
and submissive to the point of tenderness. Very
generously did she fulfil her promise. As I rowed,
she sang to me the sweetest songs of France, and
Italy, and love songs all. It was indeed a rapturous,
golden dream. When at times she ceased to
sing we neither of us spoke, but gazed silently into
each other's eyes, until the music in her woke to
song again.
</P>

<P>
We came at noon to the pretty little island she
foretold; and I made her sit upon a rug while I
prepared our lunch. It was strange indeed how
truly all her prophesies came true. The lunch was
a very merry interlude. We both ate heartily, and
we pledged each other often in champagne. Afterwards
we started on our way again, and only when
we came upon a lock did I remember that there was
a world of living people near us. So slow and idle
was our journeying that twilight had already fallen
as we passed by Staines. About that time I noticed
that Marion maintained a longer silence than her
wont, and a little later I felt a sudden thrill to see
her shivering. She was looking over the side of the
boat, gazing sadly on the rippled surface of the
stream.
</P>

<P>
"Are you cold, dear one?" I asked, and I paused
to watch her, leaning on the sculls.
</P>

<P>
She shook her head.
</P>

<P>
"Then you shivered at a thought," I ventured.
"Please to tell me what it was?"
</P>

<P>
"I thought of death," she said, and turning,
looked into my eyes. Her own were alight with a
rich sombre glow.
</P>

<P>
"Of death! and why of death&mdash;to-day?"
</P>

<P>
"Death, Agar, my friend," she answered&mdash;she
had named me so since morning,&mdash;"is never long
a stranger from my thoughts."
</P>

<P>
"What! and you so young, so beautiful," I cried.
</P>

<P>
"It is because I fear death, Agar. I have seen
him in a thousand forms, and each form was more
dreadful than the last. There are some who grow
familiar with his face and finish by despising him.
I, on the contrary, fear him more and more. But
you, my friend, how do you regard him?"
</P>

<P>
"I have never asked myself the question."
</P>

<P>
"Then ask it now!"
</P>

<P>
"A morbid fancy, Marion!"
</P>

<P>
"Yet humour me, my friend; I wish to know."
</P>

<P>
To me her eyes seemed passionately curious, and
I marvelled at her mood. But I answered gravely.
</P>

<P>
"I neither despise nor fear him, Marion. When
in the press of time he calls for me, I shall bow to
the inevitable with what dignity I can."
</P>

<P>
"I think you are a brave man, Agar," she replied.
"You must be indeed, yet it is a thing that puzzles
me."
</P>

<P>
"Why?" I questioned with a smile.
</P>

<P>
"Because a brave man should be honest too, and
you are not."
</P>

<P>
"You are remembering the deceit I practised on
Sir William Dagmar?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes; and other happenings."
</P>

<P>
"What else?"
</P>

<P>
"I am remembering the night my lover died!"
She bent a little forward as she spoke, and her eyes
burned into mine. I caught my breath, and I felt
my hand gripped as with a hand.
</P>

<P>
"You bore me from the room of death," she proceeded
in a tense passionate whisper, "and you laid
me down upon my bed, and then you kissed my
brow. I did not know you at the time, for you were
very cunningly disguised&mdash;but now I know."
</P>

<P>
It never occurred to me to deny, or even to
demand the origin of her discovery. Indeed, incredible
as it may appear, I experienced some sort
of delight to learn that she was thoroughly acquainted
with my villainy. Quick as a flash I said
to myself: "She knows, and yet she has not turned
from me. It must be that she loves!"
</P>

<P>
"I believed that you were utterly insensible," I
gasped.
</P>

<P>
She sighed and leaned back in her seat. A long
silence fell between us. My thoughts were in a
tangled whirl. I could not grasp the skein of them,
and I seemed to be plucking helplessly after a dozen
elusive phantom-like ideas.
</P>

<P>
At last I heard her say: "It was for me he died,
Agar!" She was alluding to the dead man,
George Cavanagh, and her tones were full of bitterness.
</P>

<P>
I waited with my eyes upon her averted face.
"He died in vain," she went on presently. "Ah,
but doubtless you already know."
</P>

<P>
"Nothing!" I muttered. "Nothing."
</P>

<P>
"He was ruined," she said sadly, "and he wished
his death to profit me&mdash;with money. Money! As
if money could atone!"
</P>

<P>
"Then he was dishonest too, as well as I," I
muttered, trying hard to smoothe all triumph from
my tones.
</P>

<P>
She uttered a low moan of pain, and wrung her
hands together. "No, no," she wailed. "He
wished to be perhaps, but I gave the money back
to them."
</P>

<P>
"I am glad of that," I cried.
</P>

<P>
She threw at me a look of fiery scorn. "You!"
she hissed; "you! Get to your work and row."
</P>

<P>
In mournful humility I immediately obeyed, and
we glided on our way again. For a long while I
dared not look at her, and when I dared I could not
see for the dark. But I knew that she was weeping,
and though I longed to comfort her, I set my teeth
and kept resolutely to my work, rowing hard in an
effort to forget. It was she who interrupted me.
I saw her white figure start suddenly erect.
</P>

<P>
"Stop!" she cried; "we have passed the place.
Go back!"
</P>

<P>
I put the boat about, and slowly we returned.
Soon at her word I shipped the sculls and allowed
the craft to drift. The silence afterwards was full
of brooding melancholy. The long, dark shadows
on the river were interspersed with flecks of shapeless
mist, which fancy shaped to spirit forms, and
ghostly arms outstretched to beckon or to wave
forbiddingly. How Marion fared I cannot guess,
but I was wretched and sunk deep in gloom. It
was a miserable ending to so glorious a day, and my
heart ached strangely as I thought of it, although
I did not reckon all my pain until I found relief at
last in her command to seek the shore. We landed
upon a long green sloping bank, fringed heavily
with willows, to one of which I moored the boat.
She left me at that occupation, and slowly climbed
the bank. But her white dress shone out through
the shadows of the grove, and soon I stood before
her. She laid her hand upon my lips and drew me
then into a very gloomy little dell entirely girt with
trees. I wondered vaguely at her action and her
cautious silence, yet as always I obeyed her wish,
and waited on her mood.
</P>

<P>
For a moment she kept very still, and then she
put her hands upon my breast.
</P>

<P>
"You love me," she said simply.
</P>

<P>
I clasped my hands on hers and answered, "Yes."
</P>

<P>
"How much?" she whispered&mdash;very low.
</P>

<P>
"More, Marion, than life."
</P>

<P>
"And you respect me?"
</P>

<P>
"More reverently than death."
</P>

<P>
"What do you wish of me?"
</P>

<P>
"Your love!"
</P>

<P>
"What will you give for it?"
</P>

<P>
"All that I can."
</P>

<P>
"And will you suffer for it? What?"
</P>

<P>
"All that you ask."
</P>

<P>
"Then kiss me, Agar."
</P>

<P>
I bent my head and pressed my lips to hers. Her
lips were very cold. But the contact set my blood
on fire and I caught her in my arms, and strained
her to my breast. She shivered in my clasp and
deeply sighed, but I rained hot kisses on her cheeks,
and eyes, and lips passionately, striving to warm
her with my passion, for I knew that she was cold,
and unresponsive too, in spite of her surrender.
</P>

<P>
But of a sudden she tore herself from my embrace
and fled. I caught her on a stretch of lawn and
held her close again. To my dismayed astonishment
she was weeping wildly. I kissed the tears
away and frantically implored her for their reason.
And yet she would do nought but sob, and gaze
around her like one distraught and terrified. "Oh,
my God!" she cried at last; "I cannot, I cannot!
I was mad to undertake this thing&mdash;mad&mdash;mad!"
</P>

<P>
"What thing, my sweetheart?" I demanded in
amazement.
</P>

<P>
For answer she threw herself into my arms and
kissed me with all the passion of her soul, once,
twice. Then drawing back, she caught my hand in
one of hers, and with the other pointed towards the
river, trembling violently the while. "Ask me
nothing now," she panted; "but let us go&mdash;quickly,
quickly. This place is haunted! See, I am half
sick with terror."
</P>

<P>
I passed my arm about her waist and would have
led her to the boat, but at that moment a short
shrill whistle sounded from the willows, and was
answered by two others from the wood. The first,
however, had hardly pierced the air, when Marion
uttered a frightful scream, and sank swooning at
my feet.
</P>

<P>
I understood then that the woman I loved had in
some fashion betrayed me. For one desperate
second I stood listening for sounds and thinking of
escape. Then anguish overwhelmed me. The transition
from my paradise of beliefs to the hell of
certainties was too rapid, for hope to spring readily
therefrom, and I thought to myself&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Let even death come, for what is there good in
life when love is wrecked and ruined!"
</P>

<P>
Uttering a groan, I fell on my knee beside her,
not knowing what I did, not caring what might
happen.
</P>

<P>
Next instant I dimly heard a rush of feet upon the
grass, a cry of rage from right to left. A sharp pain
quivered through my brain. I saw a blaze of light
that faded quickly into unalleviated blackness. I
felt the world swing with a sickening revolution
round, and then came sweet encompassing oblivion.

TORTURE
</H4>

<P>
I dreamed that my nostrils were being tickled
with a straw. After awhile the sensation became
intolerable. I knew that I was dreaming, yet
I wished to wake up. Sleep, however, pressed with
a heavy hand upon my eyelids, and I contended long
and desperately without at all persuading him to go.
</P>

<P>
At last a voice said, "That will do, Jussieu, he is
coming round."
</P>

<P>
I opened my eyes at once, with extraordinary
ease, considering my long struggle, and I looked
up into the impassive countenance of Sir Charles
Venner. I was seated upright in a high-backed
chair, strapped securely in position, strapped in
such a way indeed that I could move only my fingers
and my toes. The negro surgeon, Jussieu,
whom I had last seen at the Kingsmere Hospital
for Consumptives, was standing to the right of Sir
Charles, and three of us were grouped about the
centre of a small uncarpeted brick-floored room scarce
twelve feet square, that was furnished only with
the chair I occupied and a bracket oil lamp whose
wick was smoking. There was one other person in
the room. The negro, Beudant, stood near the
closed door, wiping upon a cloth a blood-smeared
lancet. I noticed that my left sleeve had been
ripped open, and that my arm was bandaged just
above the elbow. Evidently they had bled me.
But why? And where was Marion? Of a sudden
I remembered all. Marion had lured me to this
river park and betrayed me with a Judas kiss into
the hands of my enemies. Too late she had repented
of her treachery and tried to save me. She
had swooned; I had knelt beside her body, and
someone had stunned me with a club. It was all
very simple. I had been a contemptible fool, and
now I must pay the price of my folly. What price
would they exact? I wondered. But I most
wondered at my indifference. They can only kill
me, I reflected, and the thought scarcely disturbed
me. Yet I was curious. There were many things
I wished to know.
</P>

<P>
"Where am I?" I asked, looking at Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
"You are in the cellar of my private house at
Staines," he answered civilly enough. "I may
inform you that I keep no servants except these
men you see, and the house is set in the middle of a
small park some hundred and fifty yards distant
from the river and at least a quarter mile from any
other building. You may therefore spare yourself
the useless trouble of shouting for help, should you
have been so minded."
</P>

<P>
"Thank you!" said I.
</P>

<P>
"Question me further, if you wish, Mr. Hume.
It will be my turn soon to play inquisitor, when you
are stronger."
</P>

<P>
"Where is Marion Le Mar?"
</P>

<P>
"She returned to London, this morning. You
have been four and twenty hours insensible."
</P>

<P>
"A clever woman that," I muttered coolly.
"You may congratulate yourself, Sir Charles, on her
assistance. But for her I would long ago have been
in France."
</P>

<P>
He smiled ironically. "You praise her too
much!" he replied. "She has served me well, it
is true; but for the last fortnight you have been
practically my prisoner."
</P>

<P>
"What do you mean?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"What I say. Do you remember Miss Le Mar
calling you to her room one certain evening and
asking you questions of your race and parentage?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"Had you left the house that evening, even the
very second she dismissed you, and indeed at any
moment since, you would have been arrested on
the instant."
</P>

<P>
"By whom?"
</P>

<P>
"By my detectives!"
</P>

<P>
"What, did you commit yourself with the
police?"
</P>

<P>
He smiled again. "Oh, no! Nevertheless, you
would have been arrested, Mr. Hume, and you
would have thought&mdash;by the police!"
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;see; but&mdash;but&mdash;how could you have known,
I mean, how could you have been sure that I was I&mdash;until
you had communicated with&mdash;with her?"
</P>

<P>
For a third time he smiled, and when he spoke it
was in a tone of genuine admiration. "You are an
able man, Mr. Hume!" said he, "but no chain is
stronger than its weakest link, and your weakest
link was revealed to me that very morning!"
</P>

<P>
"Ah! what was it?"
</P>

<P>
"An advertisement in the personal column of the
<i>Daily Mail</i>."
</P>

<P>
"You deal in mysteries!" I cried impatiently,
"I never inserted such an advertisement in my
life."
</P>

<P>
"It ran like this"&mdash;replied Sir Charles. "If
the gentleman who left a plain, oak coffin in the
front room of number 904 Old Kent Road on the
morning of the &mdash;&mdash; day of &mdash;&mdash;, does not claim it
within fourteen days from date, it will be sold to pay
expenses. Sarah Rosenbaum!"
</P>

<P>
"The idiot!" I gasped. "I gave it to her!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles burst out laughing. "Did you?"
he cried&mdash;"did you indeed? Well luckily for me
she could not have understood you!"
</P>

<P>
"Do you mean to say, sir, it was only that advertisement
which put you on my track?"
</P>

<P>
"That, and only that. I suspected you before,
but I confess that you were adroit enough to allay
my suspicions and hoodwink me completely!"
</P>

<P>
"Oh! Lord," I groaned. "To think that a
frowsy, oily haired Jewess should be the cause of
my undoing. Why in the name of goodness was
she not satisfied to take the coffin for a gift!"
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps she was afraid to sell it, or perhaps
she tried to sell it and could not show a title to its
would-be purchaser. You should not condemn her,
Hume, upon <i>ex parte</i> evidence. Pardon me for
saying it, but the fault was yours. You should not
have given her the coffin at all. You should have
got rid of it by other means!"
</P>

<P>
"Too true!" I groaned. "But I only wanted
a day's grace then, or I'd not have been so careless!"
</P>

<P>
"You had seven!" he exclaimed. "The advertisement
 did not appear for a week!"<BR>
</P>

<P>
I felt my cheeks crimson. "After all," I muttered,
"you owe everything to Marion."
</P>

<P>
"Were you really such a fool," he cried.
</P>

<P>
I nodded. "Give me to drink!" I said. "I'm
feeling weak and sick."
</P>

<P>
He made a sign, and one of the negroes hurried
out. I was very near swooning, when I felt my
chair tipped back, and something was forced
between my teeth. I drank and was revived. Then
one of the negroes fed me with a bowl of soup and
soon my strength was perfectly restored. Sir
Charles Venner waited all the time before me,
occasionally feeling my pulse. He seemed satisfied
at last that my condition warranted his promised
inquisition, and he proceeded straight away to
business.
</P>

<P>
"Where are the jewels?" he demanded. "The
jewels you purchased with the ten thousand pounds
that you extorted from me?"
</P>

<P>
"In a safe place." I replied.
</P>

<P>
"But you must tell me where, Mr. Hume," he
said, in a pleasant but determined voice.
</P>

<P>
"Ah, but you must first tell me what you intend
to do with me, Sir Charles."
</P>

<P>
He shrugged his shoulders. "What can I do but
kill you?" he replied. "I dare not let you go, and
you are too infernally adroit to keep a prisoner!
Come, Hume, I'll make a bargain with you. Give
me the jewels, and I'll promise you your choice of
deaths."
</P>

<P>
"Done with you!" I cried. "I choose old
age!"
</P>

<P>
"Senility is not for you, my friend; I spoke of
sudden deaths."
</P>

<P>
"Then we can't trade, Sir Charles!"
</P>

<P>
"Let me remind you that I am a surgeon, Hume.
Some deaths are extraordinarily painful. You, who
are no anatomist, I think, would be surprised to
learn how tenaciously the soul may cling to its clay
casket, and how deep are the wells of agony that it
will often plumb before it can be prevailed upon to
seek another sphere of usefulness. Now I am not a
cruel man, and I should not like to see you suffer too
protractedly. Let me persuade you not to force my
hand."
</P>

<P>
"Give me a night to think it over," I replied.
</P>

<P>
"Why delay? No, Hume, I cannot grant your
wish in any case. I have to perform a difficult
operation to-morrow, and if my mind were occupied
with doubts, I might not do my patient justice. If
I left you here alive I should be uneasy, my knife
might slip&mdash;a thousand accidents might happen.
Improbable as it seems, you might escape."
</P>

<P>
"You have determined then to murder me tonight?"
I gasped.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"But, you fool!" I cried, seeing one gleam of
hope. "How then can you be sure of getting the
jewels. I have only to tell you a lie in order to rob
you of them for ever!"
</P>

<P>
The man positively started; nor did he attempt
to conceal his mind.
</P>

<P>
"Hum!" he muttered. "That is a point I had
overlooked." Of a sudden, however, his lips parted
in a smile and his eyes gleamed.
</P>

<P>
"Well, well," he said. "Since there's no help,
I needs must let you live a day or two. But in
order to save time, Hume, be good enough to tell
me your first lie at once?"
</P>

<P>
"You mean?"
</P>

<P>
"I'll be quite frank with you, my man. This is
my meaning. You will presently mention a place
where the jewels may be but are not. I shall prove
during to-morrow that you have lied. And to-morrow
night we'll speak again&mdash;and you will then
tell me the truth. You understand?"
</P>

<P>
"You mean, that to-morrow night you will torture
me?"
</P>

<P>
"Just so."
</P>

<P>
"And if I refuse to speak to-night?"
</P>

<P>
"You will sleep poorly, I'm afraid, my friend.
But come, be reasonable. You pleaded for a night's
reflection. I offer it to you."
</P>

<P>
"But with a sure prospect of torture on the
morrow."
</P>

<P>
"Unless you speak the truth to-night."
</P>

<P>
"Then I shall!" I cried with a shudder. "Better
death than torture!"
</P>

<P>
"Well?"
</P>

<P>
"The jewels are in Sir William Dagmar's house.
You will&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"You lie," he interjected sharply. "I drugged
and searched you the night that you returned from
robbing me."
</P>

<P>
"I know that, sir; but the very next day I went out
and brought them to the house, I couldn't bear to
have them any longer out of my reach."
</P>

<P>
"Ah!" His looks pierced me, but I did not
flick an eyelash as I steadily returned his stare.
</P>

<P>
"Go on!" he said at length. "Where are they
hidden, then?"
</P>

<P>
"Marion Le Mar has them, Sir Charles. I gave
them to her when we left the house last morning?"
</P>

<P>
"What?" he shouted. "What?"
</P>

<P>
"It is true," I answered glibly. "I gave them
to her wrapped up in a small sealed parcel, which I
asked her to keep for me in her box until we had
returned. I acted so for this reason. It occurred
to me that you or someone might take a notion to
search my room while I was away, but I felt pretty
sure you'd never dream of searching Marion's box."
</P>

<P>
It were as well for me perhaps to explain straight
away the monstrous falsehood last recorded.
An instinct taught me that Sir Charles Venner entertained
but small respect for women. I saw that
he wanted the jewels very badly, and I fancied that
if I could make him believe the story I had so readily
invented, I might still live for many days. His
natural course would be at once to demand from
Marion the packet which I declared that I had given
her. As I had given her nothing, she would truthfully
repudiate his claim. But Sir Charles Venner's
want of respect for women would immediately
induce him to doubt the honesty of Marion's denial.
He would think, "she has opened the packet, and
the jewels&mdash;treasures so dear to women's eyes&mdash;have
stolen her honour."
</P>

<P>
I would act thereafter so as subtly to foster his
suspicions, and I hoped that at last, in order to
satisfy himself whether Marion or I spoke true, he
would confront me with the beautiful woman, for
love of whom I had to die. I felt that I would be
content to perish, given in exchange one opportunity
to hurl at her my hate. As deep and tender as had
been my love, so bitter and so ardent was my hate!
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles eyed me for a moment in thoughtful
silence. Then very slowly he nodded his head.
</P>

<P>
"Did you tell her what it was you gave her?"
he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"No."
</P>

<P>
"Why do you tell me now? It will cost you
a day of life if you spoke the truth."
</P>

<P>
I permitted myself a show of passion.
</P>

<P>
"A life of which I am weary, weary! Have you
ever loved, you man of ice? Have you ever been
betrayed by the creature you adored?" I cried.
"I would to God that you had killed me as I knelt
beside her body in the park. I had then hardly
realized her treachery!" I closed my eyes and
shuddered, straining my muscles as though in a
paroxysm of mental agony, the while.
</P>

<P>
"Hume!" said Sir Charles, "if you are not
acting, you are desperate, and you have not lied to
me. Take my advice and die while you are desperate!
A pin prick and all will be over. I can
promise you no pain."
</P>

<P>
The fact is I had acted far too well. It was
necessary then to surpass my former effort in order
to save my life, and at the same time make him
continue to believe in me.
</P>

<P>
I opened my eyes and looked up at him, at first
with a vacant stare. "She sold me with a Judas
kiss!" I muttered, "a cursed traitress&mdash;with a
Judas kiss. You've promised me my choice of
deaths. You'll keep your word, Sir Charles, or by
the God above us&mdash;you'll die a fouler death than
I."
</P>

<P>
I gave him a look of such concentrated rage as I
concluded, that, bound though I was, he started
back a step and bit his lip.
</P>

<P>
"Well, well!" he exclaimed, "I'll keep my
word, you need not fear."
</P>

<P>
"Then bring me a cross, and nail me to it&mdash;in my
senses while I live, and while I bleed to death&mdash;you'll
drag her here to see me&mdash;so that I may curse
her as I die!"
</P>

<P>
"The man is mad!" he gasped, "mad as a March
hare!"
</P>

<P>
"Keep your word!" furiously I hissed. "I
bind you to your word!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles exchanged fearful glances with the
negroes. I watched him, frowning like a thunder-cloud.
</P>

<P>
"Come, come!" he said at last. "You must
sleep over this, Hume! You must not set me a
task beyond my power&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
But I broke in upon him with a curse. "What!"
I shrieked. "You bragged and bleated of the
torture you had in store for me&mdash;and when I bid
you kill me as I wish to die, you shrink and blanch
and mouth your feminine humanity. But you've
given me your promise&mdash;and you'll keep it or by&mdash;"
I finished with a storm of maledictions so blasphemously
horrible, and which I delivered with such
wild and awful force, that even the stolid negroes
staggered back and rolled their eyes. As for Sir
Charles, he turned sheet white before I was half
through, and with a look of something marvellously
resembling terror, he turned and simply rushed out
of the room.
</P>

<P>
I screamed my curses after him, straining and
tugging at my bonds like one possessed. But at
length, thoroughly outworn with the exertion, I
stopped and feigned to swoon.
</P>

<P>
Next moment the cellar was in darkness, and I
heard the negroes stumble out and bolt the door
behind them.
</P>

<P>
I'll not relate the anguish I endured that night,
more than to say it made an old man of me&mdash;in mind,
if not in body. I did not sleep. I could not if I
would, for I was companied with memories sharp
enough to sting a soul from torpor deep as death.
And I would not, if I could, because I feared that
those were by me who might take advantage of my
slumber to extend my sleep beyond mortality.
</P>

<P>
But none came near me, and through the dragging
hours I heard no sound. Morning came without
the black dark lessening one whit, until the negro,
Beudant, brought a candle with some breakfast. He
was plainly afraid of me at first, and without doubt
I was not a pleasant thing to gaze upon. But his
fears faded as he fed me and saw me grateful for the
food.
</P>

<P>
"You are in a gentler mood, monsieur, than
overnight," he presently remarked. "It is better
so, believe me. If I were you, I would not die upon
a cross."
</P>

<P>
"Just so," I answered quickly. "I do not wish
to die at all, would you like to make yourself a
rich man, M. Beudant?"
</P>

<P>
"Why, yes, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"Then help me to escape, and I shall fill your
hands with gold."
</P>

<P>
"But in that case I should incur my patron's
enmity."
</P>

<P>
"And in the other you will run a very certain
risk of being hanged."
</P>

<P>
"Even so, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"You fear your patron more keenly than the
law!" I cried. "Believe me, you are wrong."
</P>

<P>
"Pardon!" he interrupted, "you mistake, monsieur.
I fear no man. Sir Charles Venner is my
patron and my teacher. But he is also my friend.
I would suffer death for him, if need arose."
</P>

<P>
I sighed. "Will he really kill me, do you think?"
I asked.
</P>

<P>
The negro pursed out his thick, black lips. "I
feel sure of it," he muttered. "As soon as once
the jewels that he seeks are in his hands, you'll
die."
</P>

<P>
"Then my hours are numbered," I said gloomily,
"for that will be to-day."
</P>

<P>
"But then, can it be, you told him truly, yesternight,
monsieur?"
</P>

<P>
"I was mad!" I groaned aloud. "Mad. Last
night I cared for nothing! I was torn apart with
rage and with despair. But now it is different." I
groaned again. "Ah! M. Beudant, is there no hope
for me? You do not look inhuman! Would you
have the murder of a fellow being on your soul.
Help me to live, if only for a little while&mdash;a few short
hours? One other day? I am not fit to die,
Beudant. Great God, no! I am not fit to die!"
</P>

<P>
"What can I do for you, monsieur?"
</P>

<P>
"Oh! it is not much I ask. Go to your patron
and persuade him that I lied last night."
</P>

<P>
"Impossible, monsieur! He has already left the
house."
</P>

<P>
"Then follow him, Beudant. I am bound or I
would beseech you on my knees. Beudant for the
love of God&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Monsieur, monsieur!"
</P>

<P>
"Kind, sweet Beudant!" I wailed. "Beautiful,
excellent Beudant, do this little thing for me.
See it is a dying man entreats you. Sweet Beudant,
pretty Beudant."
</P>

<P>
The poor negro looked the picture of distress.
His eyes rolled in his head, and he knew not what to
do or say.
</P>

<P>
"I cannot deceive my patron!" he cried at
last.
</P>

<P>
But at that I shrieked aloud and drove him from
the room with venomous blood-curdling curses. In
his agitation he forgot to take with him the candle,
which he had set upon the floor, and that circumstance
gave me an occupation for some hours which
in some degree alleviated my dark mood of bitterness.
I thought that by dint of great stress and labour
I might work my chair beside the flame and sear
through some or other of my bonds. In four hours
of constant effort I had moved a foot perhaps, but
then I gave up in despair, for I had still a yard to
go and already the candle guttered in its socket.
</P>

<P>
Jussieu was the next to visit me, bearing on a
tray my mid-day meal. After eating heartily, I
tested him in much the fashion I had tried on Beudant.
He gave me similar replies, and I rewarded
him with similar maledictions. But instead of
flying from my oaths as the other negro had, to my
astonishment, he quelled me with a rolling sermon,
delivered in the finest Lutheran style. Texts
quivered from his tongue, like shafts of lightning
in a storm, and the black canting hypocrite, who
was ready at his master's nod to murder me, dared
preach to me of penitence, and summoned me in
thunderous tones to prepare my soul for death.
</P>

<P>
At first rage and indignation held me speechless;
but when the humour of the situation struck me
properly, I yelled with laughter, and laughed and
laughed until my ribs ached and the tears trickled
down my cheeks.
</P>

<P>
When I had sobered he was gone, and I was glad,
despite the dark. I am too good a hypocrite myself
to endure a man whose hypocrisy may be
pierced with a pin. And though I had laughed at
him, too much of Jussieu would have made me sick.
</P>

<P>
Seven hours later Sir Charles Venner entered my
prison cellar with his ebony attendants, who bore
between them a small table spread with lamps, and
one or two strange ugly looking implements.
</P>

<P>
The surgeon wore a gloomy look, and he made no
answer to my courteous greeting. But bidding
Beudant shut the door, he turned to me and said:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Hume, after all you lied to me!"
</P>

<P>
"What!" I cried as if dumbfounded. Then
quickly recovering my countenance, I exclaimed.
"Oh, yes, yes. You have discovered it. Yes,
yes, I lied to you. The jewels are really hidden
behind the second volume of Bruton's "Anatomy
of Melancholy" in the bookshelf on the eastern
wall of Sir William Dagmar's library."
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles favoured me with a black frown.
"You are such an accomplished liar!" he said
coldly, "that I can no longer rely upon your unsupported
word."
</P>

<P>
"What would you do?" I cried.
</P>

<P>
"Persuade you to be honest with a foretaste of
damnation!"
</P>

<P>
At that I felt my blood turn cold within me, and
yet strange to say a hot sweat broke out on my
forehead and my face.
</P>

<P>
"You monster!" I gasped. "You would really
torture me?"
</P>

<P>
"I shall," he retorted. "Jussieu, will you please
to operate."
</P>

<P>
"But certainly, monsieur," replied the brutal
preacher, with a grin of malice which showed me
that my laughter had not failed to prick his vanity.
</P>

<P>
He seized one of the implements that I had noted
and immediately approached my chair. In another
moment my left hand was encased in a curious
steel glove, which held the fingers widely separated
in rigid iron stalls. I tremulously assured myself
this was a farce to try my nerve; and resolving
not to watch the leering villain at his work, I looked
up at Sir Charles, who met my eyes as impassively
as ever.
</P>

<P>
"A test?" I sneered.
</P>

<P>
"Yes, a test," said he.
</P>

<P>
Next instant I uttered a scream of agony, for a
burning pain had suddenly pierced my thumb. I
looked at it and saw that a long needle had been
inserted down the joint between the nail and quick.
Jussieu was already busy at my forefinger. "Mercy
mercy," I shouted. "I'll tell you the truth, the
truth!"
</P>

<P>
"Then speak!"
</P>

<P>
"She has them, Marion!"
</P>

<P>
"Once more, Jussieu?" said Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
Again that penetrating agony. Again I raved
and screamed. Again I swore I'd tell the truth.
</P>

<P>
"Speak!" cried Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
"They are in Sir William Dagmar's library, where
I said before, behind&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Once more, Jussieu!" interrupted the surgeon.
</P>

<P>
I lost sight of the agonizing periods. I fainted
more than once and was restored to life by pain.
Sometimes I lied, more often still I shrieked aloud
the truth, and was not credited. But at last growing
wise under the torture, I perceived what my
inquisitor wished me most to say, and I vowed time
after time that Marion possessed the jewels, and
Marion alone. At last Sir Charles decided to believe me,
and my mangled hand was grudgingly
released. I was by then well-nigh incapable of
feeling, and they might have murdered me without
exciting in my breast one added solitary pang.
</P>

<P>
I fell into a heavy sleep before they left the room,
and when I awoke I was benumbed and very listless.
I became, however, gradually aware that much
had been done during my unconsciousness which
must have lasted hours. The table remained in the
room, and a lamp thereon cast a yellow glitter round
the plastered walls. To the left of my chair there
yawned a deep hole in the floor, something coffin
shaped, with bricks and earth and stones heaped
against the wall behind. Two spades were sticking
in the rubble, and a pick. Very patently it was a
grave, my grave! I gazed at it with a sort of
solemn wonder, but I thought it might prove a
friend, if it would only save me from such horrors as
I shuddered to remember I had lately undergone.
After a time I realized that I was listening to a faint
bubbling sound that seemed to issue from my
grave. Then I noted in the shadowy depths a
whitish froth, and understood! My grave promised
me, as well as death, obliteration, nay, absolute
annihilation. It was partly filled with seething
quicklime!
</P>

<P>
Beudant came and made me eat and drink. I
was very faint and only asked him for the time. He
told me it was two o'clock upon the fourth day of
my imprisonment.
</P>

<P>
While wondering at the news, I fell asleep. Beudant
awoke me with more food and drink. Again
I fell asleep, and again I awoke to find myself being
softly carried from the cellar of my grave, into an
adjoining room that was also situated underground,
for it, too, was plastered walled and windowless. It
contained, however, a long rack furnished with some
dozens of champagne, neck downwards, and most
carefully bestowed.
</P>

<P>
"A good vintage! I should say," I said to Beudant.
Satan himself could not have made me to
speak to Jussieu, except with sneers.
</P>

<P>
"You shall judge, monsieur!" replied the negro,
and when he set me down, he took a bottle from the
rack and proceeded to unfold the cork.
</P>

<P>
"Why this sudden kindness to an <i>ame damnée</i>!"
I asked indifferently. "Has my last hour come?"
</P>

<P>
"God knows, monsieur; but you are, I think, to have
a visitor, and I have orders! Kindly drink!"
</P>

<P>
He poured out a full cup of the frothy nectar, and
held it to my lips. I quaffed it slowly, and felt the
life blood surge anew along my veins. Also I felt
my lacerated hand begin to pain, and soon I groaned
aloud. Beudant on instant was a kind physician,
and I blessed him as he poured some warm and
grateful balsam on the wounds, and bound my injured
fingers in a swathe of silk.
</P>

<P>
"Beudant." said I, "whichever takes me, Beelzebub
or Satan, when I go, I'll sing your praises to him
as a man of heart."
</P>

<P>
"Peace, blasphemer!" grated Jussieu.
</P>

<P>
"Peace yourself, you canting hound!" I cried.
</P>

<P>
For answer he smote me on the mouth. But that
was too much even for me, who till that moment
honestly believed that I was destitute of pride. I
discovered at the touch of a blackfellow's paw that,
at all events, I had a pride of race. I filled my lungs
with air and shouted like a Stentor: "Help! Help!
Murder! Murder!"
</P>

<P>
Jussieu shook like a leaf. "You blasted pig!"
he muttered&mdash;very low. "God strike you dead!"
</P>

<P>
Truly his religion, for all his preaching, was not
deep.
</P>

<P>
But Sir Charles Venner's voice answered at once,
in very angry tones: "Beudant, Jussieu, what the
devil are you doing?"
</P>

<P>
Next instant the door opened. I saw the tail
end of a flight of brick steps, and into the room
rushed Marion Le Mar, followed less quickly by the
surgeon, who stopped to lock the door behind him.
The girl stopped midway on the floor. But I did
not look at her. I was too deeply agitated, and I
wished to gather up my strength for later use.
</P>

<P>
I heard Sir Charles repeat his question. Jussieu
replied&mdash;"Master, he blasphemed, and I struck him
on the mouth."
</P>

<P>
Pride of race is a curious thing. I found I could
not argue with the negro, though he had lied.
</P>

<P>
The surgeon whipped his servant with a dozen
scorching words, then strode beside my chair.
</P>

<P>
"For this insult, Hume," he said, "I offer you my
sincere apologies. Such a thing will not occur
again!"
</P>

<P>
"Give me another cup of wine," I cried, "and
I'll forgive you."
</P>

<P>
Within a moment it was held up to my lips, and
I drained it at one draught. I was passionately
craving strength to show my hate to Marion.
Heaven! How I hated her!
</P>

<P>
"More?" asked Sir Charles.
</P>

<P>
"No," I answered sullenly; my eyes fell upon the
floor.
</P>

<P>
"Mademoiselle Le Mar denies that you gave her
any packet, Hume?"
</P>

<P>
"Does she?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, and she is here to confront you?"
</P>

<P>
"Why?"
</P>

<P>
"To induce you to confess your falsehood!"
</P>

<P>
"And if I don't?"
</P>

<P>
"It will go harder with you than before!"
</P>

<P>
I ground my teeth. "Bah!" I snarled, "you
doubt her word, or you'd not have brought her here.
I see your game, you wish to make her own her theft
by witnessing my torture. But you will fail, you
fool. Do you forget that she betrayed me? She'll
laugh to hear my screams!"
</P>

<P>
Marion spoke for the first time. "Sir Charles,"
she began, in low vibrating tones, "this man looks
very ill. What have you done with him, and what
is the matter with his hand?"
</P>

<P>
"He will tell you," said the surgeon curtly.
</P>

<P>
I looked up at her for the first time. Her eyes
were dilated, and full of passionate questioning.
</P>

<P>
"You pretty actress!" I sneered, "you know
nothing, oh, of course, you know nothing!"
</P>

<P>
"Miss Le Mar knows nothing, Hume," said Sir
Charles, in tones of ice. "But it is time she knew.
You will tell her, or shall I?"
</P>

<P>
"You," I muttered. I was a little dazed. Marion
had not thought to have me tortured then. I had
to readjust my mind, concerning her.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles nodded, and the girl and he gazed into
each other's eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Tell me!" she cried.
</P>

<P>
"His fingers have been pierced with frozen probes
between the nail and quick!"
</P>

<P>
It seemed to me that an hour passed before their
glances parted. But at last Marion uttered a little
gasping sigh and slowly turned to me. Her face
was very pale. "How you must loathe me!" she
muttered.
</P>

<P>
"Yes!" I answered simply. "But you will
better understand how much, if you will trouble
to explore the room I lately occupied!"
</P>

<P>
"Come!" said Sir Charles, at once, and he
strode across the cellar.
</P>

<P>
They were not absent long, yet when they returned
Marion had some colour in her face. It
seemed they had been talking, but I heard the end
of their discourse.
</P>

<P>
"You should have known it, child," Sir Charles
was saying. "I did not use bald words, because I
trusted your intelligence. 'A long voyage' was
the term I used. It bore one application only in
my mind. You must perceive how utterly impossible
it is that he should live. Why, if we kept
him prisoner, he might escape&mdash;ten, twenty years
hence even, and yet he still could ruin us!"
</P>

<P>
"But you spoke also of an island?"
</P>

<P>
"An island of dreams, Marion!" he replied
impatiently. "Come, come, we waste time. You
must be sensible!"
</P>

<P>
She bowed her head before him and appeared to
think.
</P>

<P>
"Come, come," he said again, still more impatiently.
</P>

<P>
"Wait!" she replied. "I begin to understand."
</P>

<P>
"Well!"
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Hume spoke truly, monsieur, you doubted
my word, and that is why you brought me here.
You think it possible that I have the jewels. Is it
not so?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes to all your questions!"
</P>

<P>
"And unless M. Hume confesses that he lied
about the packet, I must behold his torture and
listen to his screams!"
</P>

<P>
"Unhappily, my child!"
</P>

<P>
"Why should you doubt my word, monsieur?
Have I ever in my life deceived you?"
</P>

<P>
He shrugged his shoulders. "How can I tell!"
he sneered.
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps, perhaps, m'sieur&mdash;if he withstands the
torture and persists to lie, you will then torture me?
You do not see, though I see. He has planned that
you should bring me here for his revenge. Therefore,
he will not tell the truth! Will you torture me,
m'sieur?"
</P>

<P>
"My child, you are a fool. It is the truth that I
am seeking. I would give you the jewels, if you
needed them. But this I shall not do&mdash;permit that
man to triumph over me, in one iota! Why,
Marion"&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;"he once obliged me
to shake hands with him!"
</P>

<P>
I thrilled to hear him, for I saw he spoke the truth,
and I understood at last how bitterly he had brooked
the way that I had used him. I could write a
sermon here on pride and vanity, if I had a mind.
Good heavens! to what heights will they not drive,
to what depths will they not drag their victims!
But let another pen than mine essay the task. It
is Homeric and beyond my powers to do it justice.
</P>

<P>
Marion left the surgeon's side, and came very
close to me. "Agar Hume," she murmured, "I
have used you ill, but how ill I did not dream till
now. As God hears me I would never have betrayed
you, if I had known it could have meant,
what it has meant, and means!"
</P>

<P>
"Go on!" said I, "your voice is very sweet."
</P>

<P>
"You loved me once," she whispered.
</P>

<P>
"I did indeed."
</P>

<P>
"By the memory of that love I implore you now
to speak the truth and forfeit your revenge. I am
only a woman, monsieur, surely my punishment is
great enough in knowing that I have brought you to
your death!"
</P>

<P>
"I'm not dead yet, mademoiselle. You reproach
yourself too soon."
</P>

<P>
"But you will die!" she cried.
</P>

<P>
"When it is written."
</P>

<P>
She clasped her hands and gazed at me beseechingly.
"I want you to look back into a night,
one night," she muttered very low, "I asked what
would you give me for my love, and you replied,
'all that I can!'"
</P>

<P>
"Too true. I was sincere as well in what I said."
</P>

<P>
"Then give to me the memory of a man!"
</P>

<P>
"And you will keep the bargain, how? By
worshipping that memory?"
</P>

<P>
She gave a little moan. "For God's sake," she
pleaded, "For God's sake, M. Hume."
</P>

<P>
"For man's sake," I retorted, "I shall speak the
truth," and looked beyond her.
</P>

<P>
"Sir Charles," said I, "I thought myself a liar
till I met this woman&mdash;and selfish too beyond comparison.
Did you ever hear the maxim I invented
for the ruling of my life? It was this:&mdash;'<i>First
person paramount!</i>' But look at her! She
dwarfs and shadows me so much, without a maxim
but her womanhood, that I can only keep my
dignity by noising my defeat. Here am I, bound,
helpless, ill, and threatened with a painful death,
because of her. But she has jewels which she sets before
my agony, and she would spare herself the
shame of witnessing that agony. Wherefore she
tries to fool me to the end, not caring what I suffer,
so that her eyes and ears are not offended."
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles nodded his head, and it is very likely
he believed me, for his eyes gleamed scorn at
Marion.
</P>

<P>
"It is your turn," he said coldly.
</P>

<P>
"My turn, monsieur," she shuddered and turned
crimson, it seemed to me with passion.
</P>

<P>
"Your turn," he repeated.
</P>

<P>
"Very well!" she cried in a voice grown hoarse
and desperate. "Torture him! Torture him!
That is all I have to say!"
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles glanced from her to the negroes.
"Light the stove," he said.
</P>

<P>
The wretches disappeared behind my chair, and
I heard one strike a lucifer.
</P>

<P>
"What is the bill of fare?" I jauntily inquired.
</P>

<P>
The surgeon smiled evilly. "I am too good a
host to keep you in suspense!" he said. "For
hors d'oeuvre, Jussieu will stroke your soles with red
hot needles. Potage&mdash;we'll fill you palms with
boiling oil. The entrée&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Hold, monsieur!" I cried. "You go too fast.
You'll spoil my appetite!"
</P>

<P>
"Your nerve is excellent!" he grudgingly admitted.
"But how long will it last? Beudant, be
good enough to bare our patient's feet."
</P>

<P>
Beudant obeyed. I have well-shaped feet, with
not a blemish upon either. I was not ashamed to
have them publicly exhibited. I could not see
them myself because of my position, but Marion
looked at them, and her glance was quickly riveted.
Her lips were moving, and she seemed to be muttering
to herself, although I heard no sound. God in
Heaven! how beautiful she was, and how I hated
her!
</P>

<P>
Within a few minutes, Jussieu re-appeared, bearing
an iron plate, upon which was arrayed a brace
of steel awls, set in wooden handles. The points
glimmered blue and red. At a nod from Sir Charles
Venner, my chair was tipped back in order to raise
the soles of my feet. My ankles were strapped
securely to the legs of the chair.
</P>

<P>
Jussieu set his plate upon the floor, and taking
one of the awls in his hand, glanced up at his master.
</P>

<P>
"One moment!" cried Marion. She darted
to the rack and seized the half-emptied champagne
bottle which Beudant had opened for my benefit.
Disdaining the cup, whose rim my lips had touched,
she raised the bottle to her mouth and bending back
her head drank deeply.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles and I exchanged glances of amusement.
A little later Marion recovered her position,
but she continued to hold the bottle. The wine
had produced an instantaneous and curious effect.
She was snow white, and her eyes were dull and
turgid. "I am ready!" she declared.
</P>

<P>
The surgeon stepped to the side of my chair, and
presenting his back to Marion put his fingers on my
right wrist.
</P>

<P>
Jussieu kneeled upon the floor, and passed his
accursed awl across my instep. The pain was so
exquisite that, although I fought like a tiger for
control, I writhed and groaned.
</P>

<P>
The torture seared again, and then I shrieked.
</P>

<P>
But Marion glided forward, and raising the heavy
bottle that she held on high, she brought it down
with a crashing blow upon Sir Charles Venner's
undefended head. The glass shivered into fragments,
and the surgeon fell without groan or cry,
unconscious at my feet.
</P>

<P>
My chair was unexpectedly released. I swung
forward, seated erect again, helpless and suffering
intensely, but uplifted to a mental contempt of
pain in a sudden rapture of astonishment. Marion,
who had stepped back almost to the farthest wall,
faced the negroes with a little cocked pistol, which
did not waver in her grasp. Her face was still
ashen coloured, but her eyes were simply on fire.
</P>

<P>
"M. Jussieu!" said she, her voice was like a
silver bell, "take up your master, if you want to
live, and carry him into the other cellar!"
</P>

<P>
The negro did not move. He glared at her from
where he kneeled, like a frozen image.
</P>

<P>
"In five seconds I shall kill you!" said the girl.
"One&mdash;two&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
Jussieu uttered a raucous cry, and scrambled to
his feet. Stooping quickly he seized the body of
Sir Charles and staggered off.
</P>

<P>
"Beudant," said Marion, "lock that door
quick!"
</P>

<P>
Beudant sprang to obey. I heard him slam the
door and shoot home the bolts.
</P>

<P>
"Now," said the girl, "release M. Hume and
take care not to hurt him."
</P>

<P>
In a moment I was free. But I could not move
so much as a muscle. I had been four days in the
chair, and I was not only cramped, but ill, frightfully
ill. There was not an organ in my body that did
not begin to give me agony immediately the supporting
straps relaxed. Even as I swayed forward, I
shrieked with pain and swooned. When I awoke I
was stretched out at length upon the floor, and
Beudant was kneading my half-naked limbs and
body with all the strength and science of a skilled
masseur. Marion, seated at a little distance on the
chair, kept the muzzle of her pistol pointed at the
negro's head. From the adjoining chamber a
curious babel of sounds proceeded. Sir Charles
Venner's voice, raised in passionate entreaties and
commands, mingled with the noise of continual
digging. Was Jussieu trying to dig a way out?
For a moment I wondered why he did not attack
the door with his pick, but then I remembered it
was thick and stout and heavily bound with iron.
</P>

<P>
For another hour Beudant continued his massage,
and Marion uttered no word nor made one move.
I could not speak, because the pain I suffered
obliged me to lock my teeth to keep from shrieking,
and even as it was I often groaned. Beudant
paused at last in sheer fatigue, and Marion permitted
him to rest. Afterwards the negro dressed me, and
bound up my wounded foot. He also gave me
more champagne and assisted me to rise. I found
that I could stand, but my muscles were flaccid and
unstrung, while every nerve was raw and quivering.
I could not move without assistance. At Marion's
command Beudant took me in his arms. He was
very strong, that negro, and he bore me as easily as
I might have done a child. She opened the door,
and we passed out before her, and mounted a flight
of brick steps into a kitchen above. Marion bolted
the door and followed us like a shadow. I was
carried thence out into the night, across a long
flagged yard into a stable, Marion always close
behind us, with a lanthorn in her hand. I was
deposited upon a truss of straw, from which vantage
post I watched Beudant, under the guidance of the
pistol, harness a quiet-looking horse, and attach it
to the shafts of a small basket phaeton. The negro
then lifted me into the body of the vehicle, and
mounting to the box took up the reins. Marion
climbed in and sat beside me. "Drive to London,
Beudant," she said quietly, "and if you value your
life keep your eyes before you!"
</P>

<P>
Heaven preserve me from the horrors of such
another drive. At every jolt and rumble of the
phaeton I felt as though I were being torn apart
upon a rack. My moans made such hideous music
for the road, that often we were stopped by travellers
with courteous questions of my state. Marion
addressed me several times with the same request:
"For God's sake, monsieur, let me give you an
injection of morphia. It will ease your pain!"
</P>

<P>
But I loathed her, and distrusted her.
</P>

<P>
"Better the pain," was my invariable response.
"Better the pain!"
</P>

<P>
"How you hate me," she would cry. "How
you hate me!"
</P>

<P>
Sometimes I felt her shiver, but not often, for I
kept as closely to my corner as I could, and if by
chance she touched me, curses trembled to my lips
which I had work to stifle.
</P>

<P>
We drove so slowly that morning had already
dawned before we reached the outskirts of the city.
We stopped then at an inn, where Beudant's shouts
procured a flask of spirits, which I drank to drug my
suffering. Afterwards I did not groan, for though
the brandy scarcely eased my pain, it gave me
strength to smother its expression.
</P>

<P>
Marion put away her pistol soon, for the road was
full of vehicles, and Beudant was no longer to be
feared. The girl's face in the early morning light
was pitifully lined and haggard. I watched her,
but she kept her gaze set straight before, as though
conscious of my stern regard. Every now and then
too, she caught her breath, and shuddered as though
she were remembering. Our silence lasted until we
came to Notting Hill, when I became aware of a
certain chilling curiosity concerning her.
</P>

<P>
"Now that you have broken with your friends,"
I muttered suddenly, "what will you do?"
</P>

<P>
She did not move, yet she answered at once in
tones of deep humility. "Whatever you wish,
monsieur!"
</P>

<P>
"Whatever I wish," I sneered. "What has my
wish to do with you?"
</P>

<P>
She turned her head and looked into my eyes.
"I have used you very ill, monsieur! I would
make atonement, though, if you will let me!"
</P>

<P>
"How?"
</P>

<P>
"In any way you please."
</P>

<P>
"Would you marry me, mademoiselle?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"You conceive then that you owe me extraordinary
reparation?"
</P>

<P>
"The greatest possible," she answered very
softly.
</P>

<P>
I knew then that I loved her still, in spite of
better cause for hate than love; but so deep was
my bitterness and sense of injury against her, that
I felt perfectly incapable of magnanimity.
</P>

<P>
"Your penitence is of sudden growth," I
sneered.
</P>

<P>
"It is none the less sincere, monsieur!"
</P>

<P>
"And your humility?"
</P>

<P>
"That too, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"I need a wife less than a servant who will nurse
me!" I said coldly.
</P>

<P>
"I will serve you, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
I looked away and reflected deeply on her words.
But though I tried, I could not understand her, and
ignorance intensified distrust. Yet I foresaw that
a period of sickness lay before me, and I could not
believe that she had saved me to again betray me.
Some one I must lean upon&mdash;it was imperative.
She watched me in most evident anxiety, scarcely
breathing the while.
</P>

<P>
I turned at last, and said:
</P>

<P>
"Have you money?"
</P>

<P>
"None, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
I felt my lip curl. It was, then, poverty which had
inspired her abject self-surrender&mdash;and perhaps, too,
fear. No doubt she relied upon my aid to escape
Sir Charles Venner's vengeance.
</P>

<P>
She read my thought, and murmured very low:
"As God hears me, you are unjust, monsieur!"
</P>

<P>
"We shall see!" I sneered. "Stop the phaeton!"
We had come upon a cab-stand. Beudant transferred
me into a fourwheeler, and Marion thereupon
commanded him to return to Staines. When he had
departed, I gave her my Bruton Street address, and
thither, in perfect silence, we proceeded. My gaolers
had disdained to rob me, but my pockets contained
less than four pounds, and it was necessary to provide
immediately against the illness I anticipated.
</P>

<P>
When we had arrived, I explained to her the
situation of my room, and bade her bring me down
my cash-box, in which reposed my cheque-book and
all my bank receipts. The box I knew was locked,
but, in order to ensure its privacy, I obliged her to
detach my latch-key from the others and give me
back the bunch. She obeyed me with a sigh, and in
five minutes she placed the cash-box in my hands.
</P>

<P>
"Where to now, monsieur?" she asked humbly,
with downcast eyes.
</P>

<P>
"To the Colonnade Hotel."
</P>

<P>
She spoke to the driver and resumed her seat.
Upon arriving at our destination, two porters
carried me within, and I engaged two adjoining
rooms on the third floor, to the larger of which I was
carefully transported. To all seeming, I was a
wounded man in charge of a nurse, for Marion wore
her uniform, and I explained to the clerk that our
luggage would presently follow us from the station,
where we had left it. We were thus able to circumvent
Mother Grundy's spirit of conventionality
without the necessity of answering a single question.
</P>

<P>
With Marion's assistance I got to bed, where I
lay for some time convulsed with agony. As soon
as I could, however, I wrote a cheque for £100, which
I gave to her for our joint use. My last recollection
is of enjoining upon her a course of conduct designed
to secure us from the persecution of our
enemies, and directing her to purchase certain
trunks and clothes so that our want of luggage
might not be evilly construed. Before I had
finished, however, I had to spur my wits with
brandy, and within an hour I was tossing in a high
fever, to all intents and purposes a helpless raving
lunatic.

"THE ANGLO-AMERICAN HOTELS LIMITED"

<BR>

<P>
I was dying, so they said: two physicians and
my nurse&mdash;Marion Le Mar. They informed
me, very gravely and gently, and the explicit motive
of their confidence was that I might have time to
make my peace with heaven, and settle my affairs
with men. It was easy to believe them. I was so
feeble. When the men of medicine had gone, Marion
surprised me by throwing herself down upon her
knees beside my bed and bursting into the most
passionate fit of weeping I have ever witnessed. As
I could not calm her, I occupied the time of her
abandonment in considering how I might provide
best for her future. I thought of a will, but dismissed
the idea, because of its publicity. Marion
could not afford to advertise her whereabouts to our
enemies. I decided at last to withdraw all my
money and the jewels from the bank and give them
to her while I lived. When, therefore, she grew
tranquil, I made her write a letter and a cheque,
both of which, with exhausting effort, I contrived
to sign. But she resolutely declined to leave me for
a moment, so I was compelled to send a waiter on
the errand. He was, by good chance, an honest
man, and an hour later my bed was strewn with
bank-notes and with flashing gems.
</P>

<P>
But Marion would not take them. She implored
me, for my soul's sake and her satisfaction, to make
full restoration to the man I had blackmailed, and
so vehemently and persistently did she entreat me
that, in very weakness, I at length gave way, only
stipulating that she should retain sufficient money
to pay the debts my illness had incurred, and to
keep her for a little while till she should find employment.
While she was packing up the jewels to send
to Sir Charles Venner, I fell asleep, and when I awoke
I was once more a pauper.
</P>

<P>
It was very curious. From that instant I grew
better, and hour by hour my strength increased.
On the evening of the fourth day, thereafter, I
arrived, after much reflection, at the conclusion that
Marion had prevailed upon the physicians to pretend
that I was dying in order to rob me of the jewels.
I also believed her story that she had restored them
to Sir Charles to be a falsehood, and I entertained
no doubt whatever but that she would presently
desert and leave me to my fate. Naturally, I kept
these opinions to myself. It was useless to discuss
them, and I told myself that such a course would
only hasten her departure. I thought her something
like a fiend in human form, but she was very beautiful,
and I loved her so madly that all I wished for
in the world was to retain her by my side as long
as possible. With that end in view, I played the
hypocrite, and let her think me every simple kind
of fool she wished. I derived a bitter-sweet satisfaction
from the game, for on her part she pretended
to be ardently attached to me. We spent the hours
building castles in the air, weaving pretty fancies
of love in a cottage, and a long life shared together.
She said she had a friend, an old kind-hearted
gentleman, whom she could depend upon to find me some
employment, as soon as I was perfectly restored to
health. I was then to turn over a new leaf, and live
an honest, hard-working life, and she would be my
wife, my comforter, my devoted helpmate, to the
end. It was a very pretty dream, but the strange
and bitter feature of it was that I sighed for it to
come true. I was tired of my rascality. My long
illness had made a changed man of me, and if I could
have believed in Marion's avowals, I would have
been as happy as a king to mend my ways for her
sweet sake, and never do a shady thing again. Once
or twice I tried my best to induce her to explain to
me the mysteries connected with Sir Charles Venner's
secret society of consumptives which I had been
unable to fathom. On that subject, however, she
maintained an adamantine reticence, and when I
ventured to press her in love's name, she entreated
me in tears to forbear, saying that she was bound
by an oath which she could not break. Her art was
perfect, for she used to add: "How, dear Agar,
could you trust me, if you proved me capable of
breaking a solemn oath, sworn to God?"
</P>

<P>
I could only have effectually answered her by
voicing my convictions of her baseness, and that
would have driven her away. On the contrary, I
praised her constancy, and received my reward from
the exquisitely assumed love-light in her glorious
brown eyes. The drama took another week to play
out. By that time I was quite out of danger, and,
although still painfully feeble, my physician assured
me that I should soon be able to leave my bed.
Marion's joy at that knew no bounds. She covered
me with kisses, and insisted that she should write
forthwith to her old friend, to inform him of her
whereabouts, and the hopes she reposed in him for
our happiness and welfare.
</P>

<P>
"What is his name, sweetheart?" I asked. I
had not troubled to inquire before.
</P>

<P>
She gave me a bright smile. "I'll tell you on our
wedding-day," she replied. "It is a little surprise
that I am keeping for you, dear."
</P>

<P>
My thought was: "She is, after all, a poor hand
at invention!" I felt convinced that she was
simply paving the way with her letter for her escape,
and when she went out to post it, I cried aloud in
my bitterness of spirit&mdash;"To-morrow morning there
will come a telegram, and she will leave me!"
</P>

<P>
So it happened! She was seated by my bed,
reading me the morning journals, when, of a sudden,
a knock sounded on the door, and a waiter entered
with a wire upon a salver. "For Nurse Hampton!"
he announced. Such was the name she had assumed
when first we came to the hotel.
</P>

<P>
Marion started up with a little cry of delight that
echoed itself in anguish in my heart. I knew what
that envelope contained as well as she. Holding
my breath, I watched her with critical intentness.
But I had no fault to find. To the very last she
maintained her part, playing it like the unimaginably
perfect actress that she was. Tearing it open,
she read its contents with an expression of happy
expectation, which quickly changed before my eyes
to fear and passionate concern.
</P>

<P>
"Mon Dieu!" she gasped, and crushing up the
paper in her hand, she turned to me. "Agar!"
she cried, "he is very ill, dying they say, and he
needs me. I must go to him at once!"
</P>

<P>
I had expected it, expected it for days, and yet,
none the less, the blow was stunning when it fell.
Indeed, in my experience, it is always the long-prevised
calamity which causes most dismay. For
a while I could not speak, and turning my head I
weakly closed my eyes in an effort to conceal the
tears which sprang unbidden there.
</P>

<P>
But when she stooped and tried to kiss me, her
falseness roused a sudden madness in my breast.
Flinging her aside, I started upright in the bed, and
all my pent-up scorn found vent. Passion lent me
strength to strip her baseness bare, and no whit did
I spare her. "Go, you Jade!" I muttered at the
last, for I was failing. "Go! and take with you my
curse! It is years since I have breathed a prayer&mdash;but
now I pray to God that never may I see your
traitoress face again!"
</P>

<P>
She stood before me, pale as death, her great eyes
blazing in her head. But not one word did she reply,
and when I fell exhausted on the pillows, she turned
with one long glance, and slowly glided from the
room.
</P>

<P>
Five minutes later, she returned, gowned for the
street, but I merely glanced at her, then closed my
eyes in icy scorn. In perfect silence she approached
the bed and placed some parcel lightly on the cover-lid.
I heard her steps retreat, and presently the
door was very softly closed.
</P>

<P>
Sure that she was gone, I started up in order to
investigate her latest act. The parcel contained
an account sheet covered with her writing, which
showed me that my debts to date approached one
hundred pounds. Within the cover were banknotes
for two hundred.
</P>

<P>
It seemed that my vituperations had stung to life
in her some lingering spark of shame. Drearily I
congratulated myself, and tried to find comfort in
the thought that, at all events, I should not be obliged
to recommence my battle with the world entirely
penniless. But I was sick at heart, sick and absolutely
hopeless.
</P>

<P>
The next week passed and left me more pronouncedly
improved in health, but desperate in
mind; so desperate that I was fit for any villainy.
For still another week I nursed myself, hating to
see my little stock of money dwindle, but not daring
to begin the struggle without a stock-in-trade of
strength.
</P>

<P>
With that at length acquired, I quitted the hotel
and went to Bruton Street, where I resolved to
take up my abode until, by dint of luck or craft, I
might repair my scattered fortunes.
</P>

<P>
My first act was to disguise myself as a professional
and somewhat portly gentleman. For a model I
took the physician who had recently attended me,
and as I had closely and frequently remarked his
ways, I was able to reproduce him with nice enough
fidelity. Having armed myself with a revolver, I
employed a cab and drove straightway to Sir Charles
Venner's residence in Harley Street, fiercely determined
to settle my account with him at once, for
good and all. To my astonishment, however, I
found the place in the hands of another surgeon,
who curtly informed me that Sir Charles Venner,
several weeks ago, had sold his practice, and gone
abroad to parts unknown. I drove thence to
Dr. Fulton's house, and a similar story was related
there. Thoroughly enraged, I went to my old
master's place in Curzon Street. The lackey, who
opened the door, seemed much astonished at my
question.
</P>

<P>
"Why, sir," said he, "Lady Farmborough lives
here now. Sir William Dagmar sold his lease to her
before he went abroad, more than a month ago!"
</P>

<P>
I turned away in growing despair, beginning at
last to perceive that the whole of the secret society
must have fled from England as soon as they had
heard of my escape from Venner's hands. But I
determined to leave no point of hope untried, and
my next visit was to the Kingsmere Hospital for
Consumptives. It was shut up, and the walls were
plastered over with placards&mdash;"<SPAN CLASS="scap">To Let</SPAN>." I then
successively attacked the houses of the remaining
members still unaccounted for, and ere the day was
done, I discovered that Mr. Humphreys had set out
upon a tour of Asia, and that Mr. Nevil Pardoe had
died suddenly upon the morning after my escape
from Staines.
</P>

<P>
My occupation was gone&mdash;reft from my hand!
As a blackmailer, I might as well incontinently close
my shutters, for there was not a soul left in Great
Britain upon whom I could levy for either money
or revenge, and I had no funds to pursue them on a
wild-goose chase abroad.
</P>

<P>
I felt that the world was going very badly with
me when I reached the end of my discoveries, but
my cup was not yet full. While waiting for my
dinner, at a restaurant in Jermyn Street, I picked
up, by chance, the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, to while away the
time and rid my mind of its unwelcome thoughts.
It was neatly folded in a small square compass, and
as I smoothed it out to turn the page, a poignantly
familiar name that was planted in the marriage
column caught my eye. A second later, trembling
with passion, I read the following announcement:&mdash;
</P>

<P>
"Dagmar&mdash;Le Mar. On the &mdash; instant, at the
bridegroom's residence, Cairo, by the Rev. François

</P>

<P>
I tore the paper into shreds, and in the act I fatuously
thought that I had torn the image of that false
fair woman from my heart. At all events, I contrived
to eat a very hearty dinner, and before I came
to coffee, I had already formed a plan to make myself
a millionaire.
</P>

<P>
I should explain that at the time of which I now
write, the historical American financial invasion of
Great Britain was in full blast. The billionaire
Yankee magnate, J. Stelfox Steele, at the head of
his omnivorous trust, had already succeeded in
enfolding within his octopus-like tentacles an alarming
number of England's richest commercial industries.
Not content with having secured our railways,
tramways and shipping, his latest achievement had
been to form a "combine" of hotel and brewery
proprietaries, with the result that two-thirds of the
breweries, and almost every important and fashionable
hotel within the confines of the kingdom were
conducted under his direction, while the entire liquor
traffic was absolutely in his grip. This prodigious
organization Mr. Stelfox Steele had named&mdash;"The
Anglo-American Hotels Limited," probably in a
spirit of derision, for although all the property was
English, the major portion of the profits were designed
to travel into Yankee pockets. It had scarcely
been registered a company before the British public
began to regard it with both fear and loathing, for
its first and immediate work of consequence had
been slightly to raise the price of beer, and at the
same time largely to increase the cost of living in
hotels. In palace, public-house and thoroughfares,
it constituted the topic of the hour. The fact is, it
affected everyone, the highest and the lowest in the
land alike, and very seldom could two men foregather
for longer than five minutes without the
exciting subject being introduced. As the "combine"
had, to some extent, victimised me during
my residence at the Colonnade Hotel, I shared in the
popular indignation, and during my convalescence
I had taken pains to make myself thoroughly acquainted
with its construction, policy and aims, and
I had carefully digested everything that had been
published concerning its promoters. Mr. Stelfox
Steele's sudden and brilliant appearance in the
financial firmament, and his consequent magnificent
and uninterruptedly successful career, had, moreover,
completely captivated my romantic fancy, and
I was quite anxious to hear as much about him as I
could. For that reason I became speedily interested
in the conversation of two gentlemen who sat
at the adjoining table while I dined.
</P>

<P>
They were of interesting appearance, certainly;
portly, conventional, bald-headed souls, both;
typical men of business, in a large way&mdash;perhaps
stockbrokers; but the matter of their talk was
decidedly exciting and suggestive to a person like
myself.
</P>

<P>
"What is this Stelfox Steele like to look at,
Gregson? You know him, don't you?" were the
first words that attracted my attention, and thereafter
I did not lose a syllable.
</P>

<P>
"Well!" replied the other, "I know him in a
way. That is to say, I have met him once or twice
in business, though I don't suppose he would recognise
me if we passed each other in the street ..."
</P>

<P>
"Oh! he is that sort, is he?"
</P>

<P>
"Now, Scott, you go too fast. I did not mean
you to infer he is a snob. But he must meet a lot
of people, don't you know, and they say his memory
for faces is not excellent."
</P>

<P>
"Is he like his photographs?"
</P>

<P>
"He is their living image."
</P>

<P>
"Then he is no Adonis, Greg."
</P>

<P>
"N&mdash;no," said Gregson, rather doubtfully. "But
I'd not call him an ugly man, Scott. There is an
air of quiet force about the fellow that marks him
from the crowd. And he has some quaint mannerisms,
too, that are not unpleasing."
</P>

<P>
"For instance?"
</P>

<P>
"Well, he grips your hand very hard and looks
very straight into your eyes, when he meets you.
It quite startles one at first, but, for my part, I don't
dislike it. It seems honest, if it isn't. Then again,
when he talks, he invariably drops his voice and half
closes his eyes, no matter what the subject is, just
as though he were making you an important confidence.
In my opinion he owes a good deal of his
success to those two apparent trifles. There's a lot
in manner, Scott; more than most people imagine,
and his manner simply provokes trust."
</P>

<P>
"Good Lord, Gregson, you don't mean to say
you like the beast!"
</P>

<P>
"Like him!" echoed the other, raising his glass.
"Why, here's to his confusion. We'll soon be all his
bond-slaves, if he has his way! You've heard about
his latest scheme, to corner wolfram, haven't
you?"
</P>

<P>
"Please the pigs," muttered Scott, "something
will break him before he brings that off. Fancy the
villain daring to even dream of interfering with the
working of our arsenals. It's bounce, of course, but
what tremendous bounce!"
</P>

<P>
"If he succeeds," said Gregson, gloomily, "the
whole world might as well become American citizens
at once. Without wolfram we'll not be able to provide
our ships with armour-plate, nor manufacture
a single big gun, except by the gracious favour of
J. Stelfox Steele."
</P>

<P>
"Is it as bad as that?"
</P>

<P>
"Very nearly. It is impossible to harden steel
properly without wolfram. Professor Bryant told
me so to-day!"
</P>

<P>
"The fellow is a public danger&mdash;by Jove!"
</P>

<P>
"Say, rather a national menace, and you will not
overstate the case. I tell you what, Scott, whoever
tripped him up would deserve well of his country."
</P>

<P>
"I'd subscribe to a monument for such an one&mdash;by
gad!"
</P>

<P>
I felt inclined to cry out at this juncture: "Sirs,
look at me, the man is found!" But I restrained
the impulse, despite the fact that I was thoroughly
elated, and perfectly persuaded too that I had a
mission to fulfil in life to save my country.
</P>

<P>
An hour later, I returned to Bruton Street, burdened
with a large bundle of photographs, which I
had purchased on the road. They represented
J. Stelfox Steele, and in every conceivable posture
and attitude which a human being can assume. I
set them about my room and began earnest study.
The head was large, and yet rather brainy than
intellectual, and the face argued a mind rather active
than reflective. The eyes were well-shaped and
neither prominent nor deep-set. The nose was
straight and shapely, like my own. Several photographs
smiled. These evidenced him to possess a
long, white set of teeth. The upper lip was long
and hairless, ergo a tenacious disposition. The
lower was thin and compressed&mdash;it helped his square,
clean-shaven chin to express a powerful determination.
For the rest he wore a short, thick, grizzled
crop of hair.
</P>

<P>
A strong, well-balanced countenance upon the
whole, and eminently easy to impersonate. Indeed,
fortune favoured me more than her wont, for my
ears and shape of face resembled his in an extraordinary
degree. I spent two hours, however, in
careful thought and anxious contemplation before
I allowed my wish to have its way. I even tried to
catch his bent of mind from his counterfeit presentments,
so that nothing might be lacking in my intended
effort. At last I arose, and opening a drawer,
examined my collection of false teeth. I soon found
the set I wanted, and in a trice made change with
those I wore. I wanted to surprise myself, so I
rigidly refrained from glancing at a mirror. My
next act was to explore my wig-box, and presently
my head was clothed. Closing my eyes, I spurred
my will, and twisted suddenly the features that
required such exercise. Finally, I stepped before
the glass. J. Stelfox Steele looked back at me&mdash;and
that result I had obtained without having employed
either paint, grease-pot, or other artifice than
those I have described. I almost wept with joy, I
felt so gratified, for already, in my dreams, I saw
myself a millionaire.
</P>

<P>
My next week was a very busy one. I procured
two suits of clothes, such as it was notorious that
the great magnate always wore. I practised half-a-dozen
hours each day before my mirror, until I had
his face by heart and could imitate it swimmingly.
And last, but not least, I purchased several piles of
newspapers that had recorded J. Stelfox Steele's
doings and sayings, manners and habits of life, over
which accounts I pored like an ardent student in
my leisure hours.
</P>

<P>
At the end of that period I was perfectly self-confident
and anxious to commence my task. I
was compelled, however, by force of circumstance, to
postpone the battle for awhile, because Mr. Stelfox
Steele had unexpectedly arrived in London. He
came, according to the papers&mdash;which were full of
him&mdash;to instal one of his co-adjutor millionaires,
named Sampson Y. May, as supreme head of the
Anglo-American Hotels Limited, during his temporary
absence in South America, whither he proposed
to proceed immediately, in order to purchase
some large tracts of wolfram-bearing territory,
whose control he needed for the perfection of the
trust he was then engaged in forming.
</P>

<P>
I was at first disgusted at the delay, but not for
long. Something caught me by the throat and said
to me: "You fool, here is the opportunity of your
life. Contrive to see the man, and then you will be
better able to secure your chances of impersonating
him successfully."
</P>

<P>
To think was to act. It was then early morning.
By ten o'clock I would have passed muster anywhere
as a good-looking, languid, idle, elderly clubman.
I wore a grey moustache, and side levers; a
slightly darker wig and a monocle. I was, in fact,
Lord Algernon Darnley. A "while you wait"
printer inscribed the name upon some pasteboards,
armed with which, I drove to the office of the Anglo-American
Hotels Limited.
</P>

<P>
My card was deferentially received, but a polite
secretary informed me that it would be impossible
for the magnate to see me without a prearranged
appointment.
</P>

<P>
"I have one," I drawled, unabashed by the rebuff,
"Mr. Steele particularly requested me, through a
common acquaintance, to call."
</P>

<P>
The secretary departed and returned. "Mr.
Steele is exceedingly busy," he declared. "He
will be glad if you will state your business to
me."
</P>

<P>
"It's private," I said calmly. "I won't keep
him long. I have a document to give him, that's
all, but it's got to be placed in his hands."
</P>

<P>
I was requested to wait five minutes. I waited
an hour, and was at last ushered to the great man's
presence.
</P>

<P>
My first thought was: "How like his photographs!"
But he was a taller man than I by a
good two inches. Gregson was quite right. He
looked me in the eyes very straight and keenly, and
he gave my hand an energetic squeeze.
</P>

<P>
"Are we acquainted?" he demanded, in sharp,
incisive tones, and he immediately sat down, pointing
briskly to a chair. "Now, what's your business?"
</P>

<P>
His voice was almost free from twang, but peculiar,
all the same. I had to pinch my leg to keep from
mimicking it to his face.
</P>

<P>
"I fibbed," I began coolly, drawling my words
to suit my character. "I could have got an introduction
easily, but what's the use when a fib would
do the trick as well, and quicker, probably. I
wanted to see you, don't you know!"
</P>

<P>
He gave a quick smile, and a quicker, though
slighter frown. "Well," he said, "you are here,
what can I do for you? I can only spare you sixty
seconds!" He took out his watch.
</P>

<P>
"I've a hundred thousand lying idle," I drawled.
</P>

<P>
"Pounds or dollars?" He half-closed his eyes,
and his tones, though rapid, dropped to a murmur.
</P>

<P>
"Pounds."
</P>

<P>
"Well, sir, that is, Lord Darnley?"
</P>

<P>
"I thought of Anglo-American Hotels?" said I.
</P>

<P>
"You could not do better," he declared.
</P>

<P>
"Thanks!" I stood up. "I'm much obliged
to you. Good-day!"
</P>

<P>
A bell tinkled, we shook hands, and I marched
off thoroughly delighted. I had his voice now, and
I knew his height;&mdash;my two weak points were
remedied.
</P>

<P>
On the following Sunday evening, at midnight, he
set out for New York, and I was one of the crowd
that watched him catch his train at Euston Station.
Next morning I searched the papers through and
through, but all they had to say of Mr. Steele was
that he had sailed. After breakfast I packed my
trunk and drove to a little unfrequented hotel in
Lambert Road, where, <i>in propriâ personâ</i>, I engaged
a bedroom and a sitting-room upon the first floor,
in my own name&mdash;Agar Hume. About an hour
later a well-dressed elderly gentleman slipped out
of my bedroom, and, descending the stairs, stepped
into the street. This person ordered a hansom to
take him to the City, giving the driver the address
of a substantial firm of stockbrokers&mdash;named Ducker
and Sims. I had previously taken care to ascertain
that the firm in question had never been in any way
connected with J. Stelfox-Steele.
</P>

<P>
Upon arrival I begged to be allowed an immediate
private interview with one of the partners, pretending
that my business was of the utmost urgency.
My prayer was granted, and I was conducted into a
massively furnished office, where a hawk-faced man,
of about forty years of age, was seated at a desk
dictating letters to an ancient shorthand writer.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Ducker?" I asked, as he glanced up.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Ducker is at present in Chicago. My name
is Sims." he replied. "Kindly take that chair.
By the way, have I the honour of your acquaintance?"
</P>

<P>
"No, Mr. Sims; my name is Brown."
</P>

<P>
"Ah! And you wished to see me&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"On private business, extremely important business,
Mr. Sims." I glanced suggestively at the
ancient shorthand writer, who appeared to be
dozing.
</P>

<P>
"My confidential clerk, Mr. Brown," explained
Mr. Sims. "You may speak before him."
</P>

<P>
"Excuse me," said I, "I am merely a messenger,
and my directions are particular."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sims raised his eyebrows, and curtly commanded
his satellite to leave the room. The ancient
awoke with a start, and nervously departed.
</P>

<P>
"May I lock the door?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
"Your business must be mighty curious, Mr.
Brown," he replied, looking utterly astonished.
</P>

<P>
"It is," I answered simply, looking straight into
his eyes.
</P>

<P>
He sprang to his feet, crossed the room, and locked
the door.
</P>

<P>
"Now?" said he, returning.
</P>

<P>
"Thank you, Mr. Sims."
</P>

<P>
"Well?"
</P>

<P>
"It is my province to convince you, sir, that by
momentarily disregarding the ordinary rules of
courtesy which hold in your profession, you may
secure a client whose business will yield you greater
profit than that of any dozen others whom you have.
Nay, sir, I speak on hearsay, but advisedly, for my
master is well aware of the substantial undertakings
of your firm."
</P>

<P>
"Your master must be a large operator," he
muttered with a gasp.
</P>

<P>
I smiled. "He is, indeed."
</P>

<P>
"And his name?"
</P>

<P>
"I am forbidden to relate it, sir."
</P>

<P>
He frowned and gazed at me, the most puzzled
and astonished man in London.
</P>

<P>
"What do you want, then," he demanded.
</P>

<P>
"My master wishes you to call upon him, Mr.
Sims. He is unable to visit you, for reasons which
he will personally explain if you will comply with
his request!"
</P>

<P>
"This is most unusual!" he replied. "Where
is he to be found?"
</P>

<P>
"I can only tell you, sir, if you consent to give
me your word, as a man of honour, that you will go
to see him at three o'clock this afternoon. I should
tell you, Mr. Sims, that if you refuse, your own will
be the only disadvantage."
</P>

<P>
"I&mdash;I&mdash;I never heard of such a thing in my life!"
he stammered. "But&mdash;but&mdash;in any case, I cannot
go&mdash;at three o'clock. I have a pressing business
engagement."
</P>

<P>
I got to my feet, smiling contemptuously. "Then
I have only to thank you for your patience, Mr.
Sims," I said, with an expressive shoulder shrug.
"Good-morning, sir!"
</P>

<P>
"I could go at four!" he cried, of a sudden.
</P>

<P>
I glanced at him, and perceived that the day was
mine. Curiosity was simply eating the man. I
smiled and, shook my head. "My master said
Three!"
</P>

<P>
"With a great effort, I could make it half-past.
What do you say, Mr. Brown; shall we split the
difference?"
</P>

<P>
"I cannot, Mr. Sims. I would be dismissed at
once."
</P>

<P>
"Then, three."
</P>

<P>
"And your word of honour, sir?"
</P>

<P>
He nodded. I liked that nod.
</P>

<P>
"You will find my master at the Golden Grove
Hotel, in Lambert Road," I said. "Kindly ask for
Mr. Agar Hume."
</P>

<P>
His face fell, and he looked absurdly disappointed.
</P>

<P>
"Agar Hume! Lambert Road!" he muttered
in amazed disgust.
</P>

<P>
"Believe me, sir, it is unwise to judge men by the
sounds of names, which may or not belong to
them. Stelfox Steele imparts a strangely furtive
signification to the ear, and yet its owner is about
the richest man and biggest operator on our little
globe. I congratulate you upon your determination.
A little later you will congratulate yourself. But
in the meanwhile, let me recommend you to keep
our interview a secret even from your partner. My
master will be best pleased so. Good-morning,
Mr. Sims!"
</P>

<P>
"One second!" he gasped. "Am I to understand&mdash;er&mdash;that&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.
Stelfox Steele&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Is on his way to America," I interrupted sharply.
"Good-morning, sir!" Whereupon, hastily unfastening
the door, I made my escape before he had
time to say another word.
</P>

<P>
After bolting an apology for a lunch, I drove back
to Lambert Road in a fourwheeler. During the
journey, I contrived to become Agar Hume again, for
I did not wish the people in my little inn to see a
dozen different persons using my room as if it belonged
to them. The driver stared at me aghast
when I alighted. He had taken up an old man,
and he put down a young one. I detest sharp-eyed
cab-drivers, they are a public nuisance.
</P>

<P>
It was striking two as I entered my bedroom. At
half-past, I resembled J. Stelfox Steele as closely as
I wished. In order to make up the difference in our
heights, I was obliged to resort to a rather inconvenient
trick. I took off my bed-clothes and spread
them doubled on the floor of my sitting-room, at
my own side of the table. These I covered with
mats, and set my chair over all. I sprang thus
two inches, in as many minutes, whether seated or
erect, but I could not leave my pedestal, without
losing those same inches; wherefore the inconvenience.
I dislike tricks of that sort, but it is my
rule never to neglect any detail that I am aware of,
and as my pedestal was hidden by the table-cloth,
and, moreover, I could not perceive any necessity
to walk about during the forthcoming interview,
I had really very little to grumble at. My last act
was to don a huge brown beard, and a pair of goggles.
These made me look like an old hayseed farmer, but
J. Stelfox Steele was underneath the disguise waiting
to disclose himself. When it wanted ten minutes to
the hour, I left my bedroom, the door of which I
locked, entered my sitting-room, and, mounting
my pedestal, I sat down to wait. I had previously
arranged a screen before the outer door, so that the
servant who would show up Mr. Sims might not
look in and remark my latest transformation.
</P>

<P>
I mention these details, not because they were of
any urgent moment, but to evidence the amount of
attention and forethought which I had bestowed
upon the business in hand. The fact is, in my experience,
it is always some absurdly finicking trifle,
which, when neglected, brings disaster to the greatest
undertakings. I was once hissed off the stage at
Newcastle-on-Tyne, when attempting to impersonate
Mr. Gladstone, because, forsooth, although
my disguise was elsewise perfect, I had not remembered
to change a pair of sharp-toed boots which I
had worn a few minutes earlier while imitating
Mr. Greatorex, a dandified celebrity of local fame.
That failure had been a very bitter pill to swallow
at the time, but it was of more real use to me than
all my triumphs put together, and I never forgot
the lesson that it inculcated.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sims was only two minutes late. In answer
to my brisk "come in, and shut the door behind
you!" he entered silently, but as he turned the
corner of the screen and caught sight of my bearded
face, he uttered an unpremeditated little nervous
laugh. "Just such a laugh any man might involuntarily
utter, who had been wishing, but not
expecting, the improbable to happen!" thought I.
His laugh, translated into words, said this&mdash;"I never
really believed you could be Stelfox Steele, Mr. Agar
Hume, in spite of what your wily secretary tried to
hint!"
</P>

<P>
I stood up, and glared at him through my
goggles.
</P>

<P>
"Mr. Sims?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
He bowed, measuring me with a sweeping hawk-sharp glance.
</P>

<P>
"Shake!" I said, of a sudden, after a full minute's
silence, and briskly extended my hand.
</P>

<P>
He responded somewhat slowly and doubtfully
to my invitation. But I tore off my goggles, and
looking him straight and keenly in the eyes, seized
his hand. I squeezed it with all my strength, then
pointed to a chair.
</P>

<P>
He obeyed with a wince, wringing his hand the
while.
</P>

<P>
"Really, Mr. Hume," he began, with a deprecating
frown, "I am at a loss&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"One second!" I interrupted, and deftly removed my beard.
</P>

<P>
He gave me one quick astonished look, then sprang
to his feet, his eyes alight, his face flushing with
excitement.
</P>

<P>
"Is it possible?" he cried.
</P>

<P>
"You know me," I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Why sir, of course!"
</P>

<P>
"But we have never met!" I cried, frowning
blackly.
</P>

<P>
"No, sir, no," he responded, hastily. "But
Mr. Stelfox Steele's face is as familiar to the public
as that of Mr. Chamberlain. I am glad to meet you,
sir."
</P>

<P>
I nodded and sat down. "Pray resume your
seat, Mr. Sims." He obeyed.
</P>

<P>
I leaned across the table and beckoned with my
hand. Next moment our heads were almost touching.
</P>

<P>
"You are wondering," said I.
</P>

<P>
"Yes," he answered frankly.
</P>

<P>
"I am supposed to be on my way to New York,"
I went on, in very low tones. "I am being impersonated
on the steamer by one of my clerks, who
will keep his cabin all the way. Before he arrives
at the other side&mdash;all will be over. I have taken
every precaution against failure. I cannot, shall
not fail, Mr. Sims, unless you fail me."
</P>

<P>
"Some big coup on exchange, I presume?" he
muttered, "and a lone hand, too&mdash;eh?"
</P>

<P>
"Exactly! But you are still wondering&mdash;speak!"
</P>

<P>
He bit his lips. "It&mdash;is the honour you have
paid me&mdash;me!" he stammered. "Messrs. Max
and Humphreys are your brokers, I believe."
</P>

<P>
"And I have no fault to find with them," I answered
quickly, "except that Sampson May, Vanderwill,
and most of my other associates also deal
with them. You understand?"
</P>

<P>
"Ah!" he cried, "I see! You'll be wanting me
to bear stocks, eh, Mr. Steele?"
</P>

<P>
I smiled in commendation of his shrewdness.
"Well, Mr. Sims," I muttered, "may I depend on
you?"
</P>

<P>
"Most certainly. I am deeply&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
I waved my hand. "Money talks," I interrupted
drily. "I require no assurances. Serve me well,
and I'll make your fortune. Fail me, and by the
God above us, I'll break you, Mr. Sims. Those are
my terms."
</P>

<P>
"Agreed!" he cried, his eyes shining like stars.
"Now, sir, your instructions. What am I to bear?"
</P>

<P>
"Anglo-American Hotels," I murmured softly.
</P>

<P>
He started upright, and gazed at me like one
confounded. "Anglo-Americans," he gasped.
</P>

<P>
"Listen," said I. "To-morrow morning you
will sell one hundred thousand shares&mdash;cash-on-delivery&mdash;to
be handed over on Saturday. The
market is at present steady at forty shillings. Your
first operation will not affect it one iota. In the
afternoon you will sell another hundred thousand&mdash;same
terms. You'll get the same figure, for, although
my associates will be nervous, they are too
deeply involved to dare let the price fall, till they
are sure, and they'll buy at evens, never dreaming
that they are bucking-up against a stone wall. Next
morning sell two hundred thousand. That will
turn the balance. The price will probably drop a
bit. In the afternoon sell three hundred thousand.
You'll find by then the market in a panic, for my
pals will have smelt a big rat, and they'll no longer
show fight. Indeed, I expect they will follow my
lead, and to save themselves, start selling too.
However, keep on selling a hundred thousand each
half-day, till the absolute slump. That will arrive
on Friday morning at latest. I reckon the shares
should by then reach bottom, say from three to seven
shillings. You will then buy scrip against deliveries
on your former sales and report to me here at 11 a.m.
on Saturday morning, with the transfers for signature.
By the way, Agar Hume is a good name, and
will look fine on the transfers. Stick to it! That
is all I need say, I think, except that I advise you to
follow my lead as far as your means allow. The
transaction will enrich you. Your commission will,
of course, be at the ordinary rate."
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sims had fallen back in his chair. His eyes
were as round as marbles, and his mouth gaped
ajar.
</P>

<P>
"You looked surprised!" I observed, with an
indulgent smile.
</P>

<P>
He passed his hand nervously across his brow, and
gave himself a little shake.
</P>

<P>
"It's colossal&mdash;but immoral!" he gasped.
"Colossally immoral! Your associates&mdash;&mdash;" he
stopped short, lacking words.
</P>

<P>
"My associates are men of business," I said,
coldly. "And they would be the first to tell you
that there is no morality involved in business transactions.
I propose to treat them as they would
treat me, if they were clever enough to perceive a
way. But we waste time, sir. The question is, are
you the man to handle the affair?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," he cried. "Indeed, yes."
</P>

<P>
I nodded and stood up. "Then adieu till Saturday.
My secretary, Brown, in the meanwhile, will
wait upon you every afternoon. Good-day, Mr.
Sims!"
</P>

<P>
He bowed, and, stammering some form of farewell,
took his departure. A moment later I locked the
door behind him, and, retiring into my inner room,
threw myself down upon the bed&mdash;to think. I had
succeeded beyond my dreams. The stockbroker
had swallowed both bait and hook like the greediest
of gudgeons. He had not asked me one difficult
question, and, whether from diffidence or obsequiousness,
he had neglected to demand the slightest proof
of my <i>bona fides</i>. Concerning the latter point, however,
I thought it possible that he might, after reflection,
return and try to repair his folly. I therefore
postponed changing my disguise for several hours,
so that I might not be caught unawares. But Mr.
Sims did not venture to come back, and when night
fell, I felt safe. I had only ten pounds left in the
world at that juncture, but I considered my future
so brilliantly assured, and I felt so satisfied with
myself, that, as Agar Hume, <i>in propria personâ</i>, I
treated myself to dinner at the Trocadero, and afterwards
to a music-hall.
</P>

<P>
I passed the next day reading a French novel,
until three o'clock in the afternoon, when I assumed
the form of Brown, Mr. Stelfox Steele's fictitious
lackey. At a little after four o'clock I entered
Mr. Sims' office, and was immediately ushered into
the stockbroker's private sanctum.
</P>

<P>
Mr. Sims began to greet me with great effusiveness,
but I cut him short, and even refused to sit
down.
</P>

<P>
"Excuse me," I said, quickly, "a certain gentleman
is very anxiously expecting my return to Lambert
Road, and I simply dare not keep him waiting
an unnecessary second. Did you sell the shares,
sir?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;two hundred thousand!"
</P>

<P>
"And the figure, Mr. Sims?"
</P>

<P>
"Forty shillings, Mr. Brown; just as he predicted!"
</P>

<P>
"Is the market at all upset?"
</P>

<P>
"Excited rather, I should say. Mr. Sampson Y.
May, the Manager of the Trust, came to see me, and
tried to pump me, but naturally, I kept a close
mouth."
</P>

<P>
"Good," said I, "my master will be pleased."
</P>

<P>
"Has he any further orders for me, Mr. Brown?"
</P>

<P>
"Only to carry on. Good-afternoon, sir! I
must hurry back."
</P>

<P>
"Good-afternoon, Mr. Brown; pray give Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Hume&mdash;my
kind regards."
</P>

<P>
I nodded and withdrew, happy as a king. But
until the same hour on the following day I suffered
the most poignant anxiety. It was relieved, however,
on the way to the stockbrokers' office. As I
drove over the bridge, the newsboys were crying
at the top of their voices: "Great fall in Anglo-American
Hotels. Panic on the Stock Exchange!"
</P>

<P>
I bought a paper and, trembling with delight, was
speedily convinced of the truth of their assertions.
The shares in the great trust, which yesterday had
stood firm at forty shillings, had already fallen to
twenty, and the market was in a state of collapse.
The journal had devoted its leading article to the
affair and, voicing the popular attitude, was mildly
jubilant at so severe a check having been given to
American enterprise. I found Mr. Sims in a state
of rapturous excitement. As soon as I had entered
the room, he locked the door, and, seizing both my
hands, he wrung them as warmly as though I had
been his dearest friend, new met after years of separation.
</P>

<P>
"To think that I almost drove you away from
my door the other day!" he cried in a whirl.
"Mr. Brown, what don't I owe you. What don't I
owe you?"
</P>

<P>
"You owe me nothing," I replied. "Your
gratitude is entirely due to Mr. Agar Hume, sir; I
was merely his messenger."
</P>

<P>
"Messenger or not," he retorted warmly, "you
brought me a message which has made my fortune,
and when this business is over I shall insist upon
making you a handsome present, Mr. Brown."
</P>

<P>
I waved my hand and shrugged my shoulders.
"My master does not allow me to accept presents,"
I said, with dignity. "But that reminds me, I am
keeping him in suspense. How many shares did you
sell to-day?"
</P>

<P>
"Five hundred thousand!"
</P>

<P>
"And the figure?"
</P>

<P>
"Forty shillings for the first hundred; thirty-five
for the second; thirty for the third, and twenty
for the last two. The price dropped like a rocket
in the last half-hour, and now the whole exchange
is full of bears; there is scarcely a single buyer
offering. I have no doubt but that to-morrow there
will be a further heavy fall."
</P>

<P>
"Hum!" said I. "Let me see, you have now
in credit for my master one million one hundred
and twenty-five thousand pounds. That is to say,
of course, on settlement. Am I right?"
</P>

<P>
"Perfectly, Mr. Brown. And for that sum I have
disposed of seven hundred thousand shares. I hope
that Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;ah&mdash;Hume&mdash;will be satisfied."
</P>

<P>
"I am sure he will be." I put on my hat. "Keep
on selling till they reach five shillings, please, then
buy scrip through another broker, or more, as fast
as possible, until we stand even. Those are my
master's latest orders, Mr. Sims."
</P>

<P>
"Very good, Mr. Brown. Anything else?"
</P>

<P>
"Not at present, sir. Good-evening!"
</P>

<P>
Next day "Anglo-American Hotels" fell as low
as four shillings, and continued at that price until
the following afternoon, when they began to rise,
owing to the heavy purchases made on my account
by the brokers employed in that behalf by Mr. Sims.
On this point I need only remark that my agents,
during that period, bought shares to replace the
fictitious ones which had been sold at my behest
for a little over £450,000.
</P>

<P>
On Saturday morning, promptly at the appointed
hour, Mr. Sims came to me, at the Golden Grove
Hotel. As may be readily imagined, I received him
in the guise of Mr. Stelfox Steele, and I took every
conceivable care that he should still persist in his
delusion. He brought with him a large bundle of
transfer forms, which it took me an hour to sign,
writing at the top of my speed, for not many of the
shares were in larger parcels than a thousand. I
subscribed them all with my own name&mdash;Agar
Hume. Mr. Sims meanwhile watching my flying
pen in respectful silence. When I had finished, I
pushed aside the papers towards him, and heaved
a deep sigh.
</P>

<P>
"Never mind details, Mr. Sims," I said, wearily,
"Brown has bored me with them through the week.
He tells me that when your commission is deducted
I am to receive £650,000?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, sir. A splendid week's work, Mr. Steele."
</P>

<P>
I shrugged my shoulders. "Not too bad, since I
was pressed for time, but a bagatelle, Mr. Sims, to
the business we shall yet do together. By the way,
I leave London to-night, but Brown will stay behind
me to receive the money. When can you be
ready to settle?"
</P>

<P>
"On Monday, at noon, if that will suit you,
Mr. Steele?"
</P>

<P>
I nodded. "It will do. Make out an open bank-cheque
and hand it to Brown, who will give you a
receipt signed by Agar Hume. You will understand
that I cannot discharge you in my own
name?"
</P>

<P>
"Certainly, sir."
</P>

<P>
"Well, Sims, I hope that you have profited by my
example and advice?"
</P>

<P>
He gave me a look of deep gratitude. "Thanks
to you, sir," he cried. "I am a rich man to-day,
that is to say, from my point of view&mdash;not yours,
sir."
</P>

<P>
"How much have you made?"
</P>

<P>
"Seventy thousand, commission included. I
cannot sufficiently express my obligation to you,
Mr. Steele. There are not many operators who will
allow their brokers to follow their lead. But you,
sir, were more than generous!"
</P>

<P>
I smiled. "I can afford such a pastime occasionally,
Sims. Besides, I liked your face. Ah! well.
I shall not detain you now, for I am very busy
myself. Good-bye!"
</P>

<P>
He stood up, and we shook hands.
</P>

<P>
"We'll meet again, sir, I hope," he cried. "You
were good enough to hint a moment since&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Yes," I interrupted, "We'll meet again. But
our acquaintanceship must necessarily be preserved
a secret from the world. Therefore be good enough
not to feel offended should we by any chance encounter
in public, and you receive no recognition at
my hands. When I want you, my secretary, Brown,
will let you know. Until then, farewell!"
</P>

<P>
He bowed deeply, and respectfully retired.
</P>

<P>
As for me, I removed my disguise as quickly as I
could, and changed my clothes. I then paid my
reckoning at the hotel, and set off for Bruton Street,
with exactly three pounds in my pocket. There I
remained until Monday afternoon, sunk in a veritable
debauch of dreams. The time passed on the
wings of brilliant fancies, and not an hour appeared
too long, despite my natural anxiety to finger the
money which my audacious dexterity had won.
My extraordinary success had, in fact, turned my
head a little, and had swelled my vanity to proportions
so magnificent that I fell into a stupor of self-reverence,
and often even forgot to eat. I awakened
at length, however, to thoughts of revenge.
Somewhere hiding from me in the world was a certain
great surgeon&mdash;named, Sir Charles Venner&mdash;who
had inflicted on my body inhuman tortures.
He had driven needles into my fingers, and he had
seared my feet with branding-irons. I had been
obliged by poverty temporarily to relinquish all idea
of vengeance. But now I was rich! rich! I sprang
to my feet with a sudden cry of rage and exultation,
savagely resolved to repay my enemy with interest
for every pang that I had suffered at his hands.
After that I dreamed no more.
</P>

<P>
My final interview with Mr. Sims was brief, but
eminently satisfactory. In exchange for a receipt
which I had written out beforehand, he handed to
me, as he thought to Mr. Brown, an open cheque,
drawn in favour of Mr. Agar Hume on the Bank of
England, for £650,000&mdash;which was marked "good."
He then shook me warmly by the hand and begged
me to allow him to make me a present. That,
however, I refused, and half-an-hour later I was
again in my room at Bruton Street, stripping off
for the last time my disguise as "Brown," the
Secretary.
</P>

<P>
I then repaired to my bank, and, much to the old
manager's astonishment, re-opened my account
there with the cheque that represented my princely
and strangely-gotten fortune. The manager did
not ask me for a reference on that occasion. Indeed,
he nearly fell over himself in his anxiety to be polite,
and he personally conducted me when I departed
to the outer door. Truly, money makes the
man.
</P>

<P>
Two days afterwards, I set out for Paris on my
way to Cairo, my pockets full of foreign gold, and
armed besides with letters of credit for large amounts.
My intention was to find, first of all, my false love,
Marion Le Mar, now Lady Dagmar. And through
her, if possible, my enemy&mdash;Sir Charles Venner.

THE HOUSE AMONG THE PINES
</H4>

<P>
Clever rascals are of necessity friendless and
incomparably lonely men. Prudence prevents
them from confiding their affairs to any other,
even their nearest and dearest; therefore they are
obliged to lead self-centred and segregated lives in
the truest sense of the term, and are absolutely prohibited
from tasting that greatest of luxuries, human
sympathy. Since my last embarkation upon a
career of villainy, I had so far escaped the pangs of
ennui, because my mind had been always occupied
with my ambition, and action had followed mercifully
fast upon design. The mere fact, however, of
having succeeded in making myself a rich man,
robbed me of that precious concern for the future
which had hitherto been my refuge from reflection.
It is true that considerations of vengeance partially
supplied its place, but as I had yet to find my
enemy before I could exchange purpose for practice,
I began to realize the utter isolation of my state. I
arrived at Paris in a desolate and listless mood, and
so wearied with my own companionship that I was
ready to make friends with a dog.
</P>

<P>
For that reason, while sipping coffee after dinner
in the saloon of the Hotel de Louvre, where I had
put up, I by no means disdained the overtures of
an old and weazened little Frenchman, who appeared
to be as lonely as myself.
</P>

<P>
He was a curious looking creature: grey, grizzled,
and stooped of shoulder. His face was seamed with
a thousand wrinkles, that even overspread his long
melancholy nose. But his eyes, although small,
were very bright, and his mouth was that of a
humourist.
</P>

<P>
He sidled up to me by degrees, evidently wishful
to make my acquaintance, and yet a little nervous
of the first step. But I met him half way with an
observation on the weather, and presently we were
seated before the same table in close and animated
conversation.
</P>

<P>
"Life is for the most part a dull and dreary affair,
monsieur," said he.
</P>

<P>
"The remark of an intelligent and experienced
man, monsieur," said I.
</P>

<P>
He bowed and smiled. "That is true, monsieur,"
he returned, "but your discernment proves that
you also possess the qualities which you have
mentioned."
</P>

<P>
"Yet in an inferior degree, for I take it that I am
your junior, and you have the air of a man who has
improved his opportunities to the utmost."
</P>

<P>
The compliment delighted him. "Monsieur," he
cried, "I am fortunate to have encountered you.
I desire to know you better. Permit me! I call
myself&mdash;Bertrand Du Gazet. I am a native of
Paris, but I have spent half my life in America,
where I acquired a certain fortune. I have but just
returned to France, to find my relatives and old
friends dead and widely scattered, and myself utterly
forgotten. It is a sad home-coming."
</P>

<P>
"Truly," I said politely. "My name, monsieur,
is Henri Belloc, and, strange to say, I too have long
been a stranger to my country. This very day I
have come back to Paris after an absence of many
years. And, like you, I have none to welcome me."
</P>

<P>
"We are then comrades in misfortune," he declared,
beaming upon me the while. "I drink,
monsieur, to our better acquaintance."
</P>

<P>
"And I," said I, raising my <i>petit verre</i> to my lips.
"I drink to its speedy ripening into friendship."
</P>

<P>
He put one hand upon his heart and extended to
me the other, which I warmly pressed.
</P>

<P>
"I am a bachelor," he observed.
</P>

<P>
"I, too, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"Of all the things in this world, I like the gaming
table," said he.
</P>

<P>
"The dice are fine thought killers, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"I loved once a beautiful woman, and she betrayed
me."
</P>

<P>
"It is a habit of the accursed sex, from which I
also have suffered."
</P>

<P>
"Monsieur!" he cried, "I perceive well that we
are destined to be friends. We have not only a
similarity of thought and sentiment, but also of
experience."
</P>

<P>
"Garçon," I shouted, "a bottle of champagne
and two glasses."
</P>

<P>
The wine was brought and we pledged each other
with effusion.
</P>

<P>
"I made my fortune out of oil," said Du Gazet.
</P>

<P>
"I made mine upon the Stock Exchange," said I.
</P>

<P>
"Mine is so great that I could not spend it in ten
years, though I lost a thousand francs a night."
</P>

<P>
"Mine is even more considerable, M. Du Gazet."
</P>

<P>
He nodded and gave me a beaming smile. "Have
you any plans for the evening, M. Belloc?"
</P>

<P>
"None," I replied.
</P>

<P>
"Then allow me to be your mentor. I know a
place not far from here where one may woo the
goddess Fortune to be kind. It is true that last
night I lost five thousand francs by hazard of the
wheel, but I would like well to recoup myself, and
shall do so, as you shall see&mdash;if you will be so good
as to come with me."
</P>

<P>
"With pleasure," I cried, and sprang to my feet.
</P>

<P>
I suspected by then that my new friend was
nothing more or less than the tout of some gaming
house. But I was reckless, and the companionship
of any rascal seemed preferable to being left alone.
A moment later we were strolling arm in arm down
the Rue St. Germain L'Auxerrois. Chatting amiably
together, we came, at the end of some few minutes, to
the Rue St. Denis, up which we turned. Shortly
after passing the Rue Mauconseil, we entered a narrow
unnamed side-street, which was nevertheless
flanked with respectable-looking houses of antique
but substantial architecture. Before the door of
one of these M. Du Gazet stopped, and giving me a
meaning glance, he proceeded to scratch upon the
panels with his ring. The signal was immediately
responded to. The door opened a few inches, and
a voice from the interior darkness demanded our
business.
</P>

<P>
"Montereau," replied my guide.
</P>

<P>
"Enter!" cried the voice, and the door swung wide.
</P>

<P>
M. Du Gazet took my arm and conducted me in
silence down a dark, thickly carpeted hall. We had
barely half traversed it, however, when the door
keeper suddenly turned on an electric lamp, and I
perceived before us a wide staircase, supported on
double rows of marble columns, that led to the floor
above.
</P>

<P>
"Good!" exclaimed my mentor. "I detest
gloom. Come, my friend."
</P>

<P>
Nothing loth, I followed him up the stairs, and a
moment later we reached a landing-stage that was
filled with huge palms growing in tubs of earthenware.
A liveried attendant guarded a closed door
that was half screened with fronds.
</P>

<P>
He looked at us inquiringly, but M. du Gazet
muttered some pass-word in his ear, and he ushered
us forthwith into an immense brilliantly illuminated
apartment, which was sparsely thronged with well-dressed
men and women, and furnished in imitation
of the Casino at Monaco.
</P>

<P>
One table was devoted to roulette, a second to
rouge et noir, and a third to baccarat. All were
occupied, but, because perhaps of the earliness of
the hour, there were not many onlookers. M. du
Gazet led me to the second named, and after watching
the game for about a quarter hour, we were both
able to secure chairs at the board, owing to the evil
fortune of the individuals we displaced. Like most
other votaries of chance, I had and have a method.
It is simple if unscientific, and it consists in backing
each colour alternately seven times in succession.
I at first contented myself with small stakes, being
anxious to watch my mentor. M. du Gazet, however,
much to my surprise, for I still believed him to
be a tout, began to gamble in earnest from the
moment he sat down, and each time he staked five
hundred francs.
</P>

<P>
"Truly," thought I, "if he is a tout, he must
have an interest in the bank, or he would not be
trusted with so much money."
</P>

<P>
After I had seen him lose four thousand francs, I
ceased to doubt his honesty, for his appearance was
transformed. The born gambler's spirit gleamed
out of his eyes. His face had assumed a warm
fixed flush, and he was absorbed in his game to the
absolute oblivion of every other circumstance. I
spoke to him in order to make sure, but he cursed
me in an undertone without turning his head. He
had in fact forgotten my existence.
</P>

<P>
Feeling more at ease, I immediately increased my
stakes, betting on the red. Luck favoured me, and
I won steadily; on the red five times out of seven,
on the black almost without a break. At the end
of an hour, so large a heap of gold and notes had
accumulated on the table before me, that it interfered
with my elbow room, and I was obliged to
stand up in order to make my game. The room had
by then become filled with people, and an interested
crowd had assembled to watch me play. Success
had made me excited, and given me a measure of
the gambling fever. I increased my stakes to the
limit and won again and again. The exclamations
of the onlookers became each moment more loud
and unrestrained, so that the croupier's directions
could only be heard at intervals: "Faites vos jeux,
Messieurs et Mesdames. Faites vos jeux! Rouge
perd. Noir gagne! Faites vos jeux!"
</P>

<P>
I was in the act of stretching out my hand to
place a large sum upon the black for the seventh
time in succession, when some inexplicable instinctive
feeling compelled me to look up from the board
and into the face of a new-comer who stood watching
the game from behind the chair of my immediate
<i>vis-à-vis</i>. The man was a negro. With a queer
thrill of apprehension I looked at him more closely,
and then for a second I was almost stunned with
surprise. He was Jussieu, the infernal canting
negro surgeon, who at the instance of his master,
Sir Charles Venner, had inflicted upon my bound
and defenceless body tortures which made me
shudder to remember, and who on his own account
had dared to lecture and insult me. Before I could
collect my scattered wits our eyes met, and the
recognition became mutual. The villain started
back a pace and glared at me, his eyes rolling in his
head. He was attired in a fashionably cut evening
suit, in which he tried to ape the gentleman, but his
immaculate linen threw out his broad black face
and hands into bold and hideous relief, and he looked
like nothing but a monster. For a moment I shook
with rage, and a murderous impulse almost overwhelmed
me. Then came a wiser thought, and I
grew calm. I said to myself: "Since the jackal is
here, the lion cannot be far away. I shall make this
scoundrel lead me to his master's lair!"
</P>

<P>
Holding him with my eyes, I fumbled with my
hands upon the table, and began to stuff my winnings
into my pockets. The crowd exclaimed in
astonishment, but I paid them no heed. Before,
however, I was half through with my business,
Jussieu tore his eyes from mine and hurried towards
the door. I sent my chair crashing behind me with
a backward kick and seized Du Gazet by the
shoulder.
</P>

<P>
"Look after my money!" I cried. "I shall see
you later at the hotel."
</P>

<P>
Without awaiting a response, I broke through the
crowd and darted after Jussieu. He had already
passed the door, but I caught up with him half way
down the stairs, and, seizing him by the shoulder,
obliged him to pause.
</P>

<P>
"What, Monsieur Jussieu!" I snarled, "would
you run away from an old friend? That is not
kind in you."
</P>

<P>
"You mistake, m'sieur!" he cried. "That is
not my name."
</P>

<P>
"Perhaps not," I muttered. "It will, however,
serve my turn. Come, monsieur!" I slipped my
arm through his and urged him down the stairs.
</P>

<P>
Although a larger man than me, he yielded like a
coward to my imperious demand, protesting volubly
the while, however, that I had made a great mistake,
that his name was Grenier, and that he had never
set eyes on me.
</P>

<P>
He was still protesting when we reached the
street. But as soon as the door of the gambling
house had closed behind us I cut him short.
</P>

<P>
"Look you, Jussieu!" I growled, "I have in my
pocket a revolver that is loaded in every chamber.
Take me at once to your master, Sir Charles Venner,
or, by the Lord, I shall put a bullet through your
head!"
</P>

<P>
"Monsieur," he began, "I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"Silence!" I interrupted. "Another word and
you are a dead man!"
</P>

<P>
A hasty glance had shown me that the street was
deserted. I produced my pistol, therefore, as I
spoke and presented it to his breast.
</P>

<P>
The negro started back, rolling his eyes like a
maniac, but he spoke no word. He was shivering
with fear. I smiled and returned the weapon to
my pocket. Thereupon I gripped his arm and
muttered in his ear: "Proceed!"
</P>

<P>
Uttering a sort of groan, he set off slowly for the
Rue Saint Denis. "Quicker!" I commanded. He
increased his pace. We turned the corner, and a
smart walk brought us quickly to the Rue D'Enghien.
Turning into that street the negro stopped
presently before the door of a large three-storied
house, whose every window was closely shuttered.
</P>

<P>
"We have arrived, monsieur," he muttered in a
hollow voice.
</P>

<P>
"You have a latch-key, perhaps?" I asked.
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
I looked steadily at the house for a moment or
two, then curtly ordered my companion to proceed,
still, however, retaining a firm hold of his arm. Five
minutes later we came to the Faubourg Poissonnière.
Hailing a <i>fiacre</i>, I invited Jussieu to enter,
and quickly took a seat beside him. "The Hotel
de Louvre!" I shouted to the driver, and we were off.
</P>

<P>
The negro was so still and docile that I began to
suspect him of meditating some plan of escape.
Producing my pistol, I thrust the muzzle into his
side and cocked it with a loud click. "Death is
very near to you, Jussieu!" I said.
</P>

<P>
"For God's sake, monsieur!" he groaned.
</P>

<P>
"Sit very still, Jussieu. It has a hair trigger,
and my hand is trembling. I am remembering that
it was you who pierced my fingers with needles and
seared my foot with branding irons!"
</P>

<P>
"Mercy, mercy! Forgive!" he wailed.
</P>

<P>
His terror was so sharp and evident that I could
not withstand the temptation to play upon it.
</P>

<P>
"Why should I pardon you?" I demanded.
"What mercy did you show to me&mdash;you infamous
wretch?"
</P>

<P>
"M'sieur, I was but the tool of others. Do not
kill me. For Christ's sake put up your pistol."
</P>

<P>
"On the contrary, Jussieu," I said in a terrible
voice. "Unless you consent to obey me implicitly,
you shall die this instant, like the dog you are!"
</P>

<P>
"Mercy, mercy!" he cried. "I shall do anything
you require&mdash;anything."
</P>

<P>
"Will you betray your master?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, yes; only, for God's sake, put up your
pistol!"
</P>

<P>
For answer I thrust the muzzle even harder into
his side. "Now," said I, "tell me!" But he
uttered a strangled cry.
</P>

<P>
"M'sieur&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I faint, I die," he gasped, and
to my astonishment he lurched forward and fell in a
limp heap at my feet. I thought at first it was a
trick, and held myself in readiness for a desperate
struggle, for in good truth I dared not use my pistol.
But the passing lamps showed me Jussieu's black
face turned almost grey, and his staring eyes hideously
upturned. The craven had swooned. I fell
back chuckling with delight, for I had been until
that moment wondering how on earth I could possibly
contrive to force the brute into my hotel in case
he should turn rusty and decline to accompany me.
</P>

<P>
As it eventuated, Jussieu was carried, still unconscious,
to my room by two burly porters, whose
garrulous surprise, occasioned by so strange a service,
I reduced to speechlessness with gold. It was
five minutes to eleven when I got rid of them. I
locked my door and approached the couch on which
the negro lay. He was beginning to wake up.
Hastily tearing a linen sheet into strips I succeeded
in securely binding his hands and feet before he had
properly regained his consciousness. I then fastened
him to the couch and stood over him with my pistol
cocked.
</P>

<P>
He opened his eyes and blinked up at me.
</P>

<P>
"In what pocket is the key of your master's
door?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"In the right hand side trouser pocket," he
answered with a shudder.
</P>

<P>
"Where is Sir Charles Venner at this moment?"
</P>

<P>
"At home, monsieur, in bed, I think."
</P>

<P>
"Does he know that you are out?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes, m'sieur."
</P>

<P>
"Where does he sleep?"
</P>

<P>
"Upstairs, m'sieur, on the second floor, the
second room on the left from the head of the staircase."
</P>

<P>
"Thanks. And who else is there in the house?"
</P>

<P>
"No&mdash;one, m'sieur." He closed his eyes.
</P>

<P>
"Think, Jussieu!" I growled. "Where is Beudant,
your brother negro?"
</P>

<P>
He did not reply.
</P>

<P>
"My hand is getting tired," I said coldly. "Let
me remind you, Jussieu, that the pistol is furnished
with a hair trigger."
</P>

<P>
The threats galvanised him.
</P>

<P>
"Beudant sleeps downstairs, on the ground floor,"
he cried.
</P>

<P>
"And the others?"
</P>

<P>
"There are no others, m'sieur."
</P>

<P>
"You do badly to lie to me, Jussieu. Say your
prayers, my man; you have just a minute to live."
</P>

<P>
His face went grey, and his eyes almost started
from his head. "Mercy, mercy!" he groaned. "I
shall tell you the whole truth."
</P>

<P>
"Quickly, then!"
</P>

<P>
"A lady occupies the third floor with her servants&mdash;while
my master, Beudant, and I dwell on the
second floor&mdash;&mdash;" He paused.
</P>

<P>
"And the ground floor, Jussieu?" I cried impatiently.
</P>

<P>
"It contains only living rooms, m'sieur. No one
sleeps there."
</P>

<P>
I nodded, for I saw that he had told me the truth.
Uncocking the revolver I seized it by the barrel and,
bending forward, before he could guess of my intention,
I struck him a violent blow over the temple
with the butt. A white man's skull would have
been shivered into fragments. Jussieu merely sighed,
but a second blow, more powerfully delivered still,
rendered him insensible. Forcing his jaws agape, I
gagged him with a towel, and afterwards ransacked
his pockets. They contained a bunch of keys, a few
gold pieces, and a handful of silver. I had scarcely
bestowed his possessions about my person when a
knock sounded on the door.
</P>

<P>
"Who is there?" I demanded, striding forward.
</P>

<P>
"It is I, monsieur, Bertrand du Gazet," answered
a muffled voice.
</P>

<P>
Cautiously opening the door I peered out, and saw
standing in the passage without the little old man
who had taken me to the gambling house. His
hands were full of notes and gold.
</P>

<P>
"It is your money I have brought you as you
requested," he observed, smiling genially. "You
were foolish to leave so soon, monsieur. Fortune
does not often so bountifully confer her favours.
See, here are more than seven thousand francs.
Indeed, you were wrong to run away, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
I was in a quandary. I could not admit my unwelcome
visitor, and I did not like to drive him
away, since he had come to do me a kindness.
Putting on a fine air of frankness, I said to him in
low tones: "My dear Du Gazet, I cannot thank you
as I ought just now&mdash;because I have a visitor, you
understand."
</P>

<P>
An expression of disgust crossed his face. He
thought, it seemed, that my visitor was of the fair
sex.
</P>

<P>
"I would not disturb you for the world," he
muttered with sarcasm, "but what of your
money?"
</P>

<P>
"Oblige me by keeping it until to-morrow."
</P>

<P>
"As you will; good-night, monsieur." He
shrugged his shoulders and departed, his whole
bearing expressive of contempt. No doubt he considered
me a liar, since I had railed against womankind
quite as bitterly as he had done not many
hours before.
</P>

<P>
I could not, however, afford to waste thought on
him, for I had much to do. Stripping off my evening
clothes, I speedily changed into a suit of dark
brown tweed, and drew on my feet a pair of felt-soled
shoes. Having armed myself with a large
sum of money and a loaded revolver, I stole softly
out of the room. While locking the door behind me
I heard a distant sigh. Swinging round I peered in
the direction of the sound, and for a fleeting fragment
of a second saw a face at the far end of the
corridor. It vanished so swiftly, however, that I
had no time to register its impression on my mind,
and a moment later I doubted that I had seen anything.
The corridor was deserted absolutely save
for myself. I waited for a few silent minutes, then,
reassured, made my way to the street. A <i>fiacre</i>
drove me to the Boulevard Poissonière, where,
having alighted, I walked to the Rue D'Enghien,
and as the clocks were chiming the hour after midnight,
I arrived before my place of destination, the
house that contained my enemy. Without pausing
an instant, I climbed the steps and noiselessly inserted
Jussieu's latch-key into the lock of the front
door. It yielded, the door opened with a slight
creak, and I crossed the threshold. I found myself
in a wide but dimly lighted hall. It was carpeted
with cocoanut matting. Doors crowded its sides,
all closed. Before me was a staircase, whose steps
were composed of slate, which had been worn away
in the middle, as if by centuries of footfalls. I was
about to mount when of a sudden a strange wonder
caught me and I paused. Until that moment blind
hate had controlled my actions and carried me
where I stood. But now I asked myself the question:
"Agar Hume, what will you do? Is it
murder that you contemplate?"
</P>

<P>
It was a fearful thought, and I shuddered as it
came. But I could not answer it. I had never
known so little of myself. In mind and body I was
alert, expectant, calm. But there was that in me
which I could not understand, a malignant remorseless
spirit which had possession of my faculties, and
which declined to be questioned or displaced. At
its command I ceased to speculate, and began instead
to listen. The house was as silent as a tomb.
Some power beyond my cognizance presently plucked
at my feet, and I found myself mounting the stairs.
I remember passing one door and turning the handle
of a second. Then I was in a room, dark as Erebus,
creeping towards a bed, upon which lay an unseen
sleeper, whose long, deep respirations guided my
stealthy movements. What ensued appeared even
then like nothing so much as the happenings of
some wild and fevered dream. I paused beside the
bed and my hands, drawn by an irresistible power,
glided light as feathers across the coverlid, across a
man's sleeping form, unto his throat. There they
settled and took hold. I heard a strangled groan.
A sudden bright light filled the room, and Sir Charles
Venner's livid outstarting eyes glared into mine.
His arms encircled me. With an almost super-human
strength he writhed beneath me from the
bed, and we fell together with a full but heavy
crash upon the floor. With a fierce and terrible
satisfaction I watched his face blacken and swell,
his tongue thicken and protrude from his ghastly
open mouth. Before, however, I could kill him, a
warning step and a loud cry sounded from the door.
Quick as lightning I sprang erect and turned. The
negro surgeon, Beudant, Jussieu's companion, was
rushing towards me, an uplifted bar of iron in his
hand to strike. I eluded him, and, springing to the
fireplace, seized a poker. I had quite forgotten my
revolver. For a moment we fenced like swordsmen
with our curious weapons, speaking no word, but
striking heavily and warding, filling the place with
the loud clang of steel. He played so well that I
could not reach his skull. But soon I remembered
having read in some old book of travel that a negro's
vulnerable point is his shin. Clenching my teeth I
made a ferocious feint at his head. He riposted, as
with a rapier, at my shoulder, but I disregarded
utterly so poor a thrust, since his bar was blunt,
and I brought my weapon down with a sweeping
swish across his outstretched knee. He uttered a
wild shriek and, dropping his bar, sank to the floor,
howling dismally. Only then I remembered my
pistol. Snatching it forth I held it to his head.
"Stop that noise, or die!" I muttered savagely.
He obeyed, but not for longer than a second
was I permitted to remain master of the situation.
</P>

<P>
"Drop that pistol, villain," cried a voice from
the doorway.
</P>

<P>
Two men had entered the room before I was
aware of it, Dr. Vernet and Dr. Fulton. Dr.
Vernet wore a shortish nightgown, from beneath
which his lean, attenuated shanks humorously
twinkled. He seemed extremely excited, and he
moved the weight of his body from one foot to the
other constantly and very quickly. Dr. Fulton was
attired in a suit of pyjamas, and he too was excited,
though he showed it less reservelessly. Both men
were armed with revolvers, which they pointed at
my breast. Glancing down the muzzles of their
weapons, I allowed my own to drop to the floor. It
would have been madness to do otherwise. Strange
to relate, at that instant, I became once more my own
master. The malignant spirit of unreasoning hate,
which had so far governed my conduct, of a
sudden left me, and I was able to realize to the
full the mad folly into which it had driven me. My
captors had only to hand me over to the police as an
apprehended housebreaker&mdash;an attempted assassin,
and nothing that I might do could save me from a
long term of imprisonment. My very spine went
cold at the idea. I looked hard at Dr. Fulton, and
saw that he was on the point of recognizing me.
</P>

<P>
"Why, it's Brown, Dagmar's valet!"
</P>

<P>
I had an inspiration. "Better any fate," thought
I, "than a French prison."
</P>

<P>
"Detective Hume of Scotland Yard!" I cried.
"Dr. Fulton, I arrest you in the King's name!
Better put down that pistol, sir, your game is up.
The street is full of my men. And if I do not go out
to them in the next few minutes they will come
for me."
</P>

<P>
"Liar!" gasped a choking voice. Sir Charles
Venner had spoken. He had recovered consciousness,
and as he uttered the word he struggled to his
feet.
</P>

<P>
"Liar yourself!" I retorted desperately. "If
you don't believe me, look out of the window."
</P>

<P>
I had a wild hope that the noise of my struggle
with Beudant might have attracted the attention
of some chance wayfarers, whom my enemies might
perhaps mistake for police. Sir Charles caught up
my revolver, cocked it leisurely, and pointed it to
my head.
</P>

<P>
"Look out of the window, Fulton," he said quietly.
</P>

<P>
Dr. Fulton crossed the room and, drawing aside
a corner of the curtain, peered through the shutter
into the street below.
</P>

<P>
While I waited for Dr. Fulton's pronouncement,
I had a moment of grace in which to think and pull
myself together. The latter I effected fairly well,
but the knowledge of my recent madness obsessed
my mind to the exclusion of every other thought
and filled my soul with bitter self-contempt. I felt
that I did not deserve to escape.
</P>

<P>
Dr. Fulton presently let the curtain fall and turned
to Sir Charles. "There are four men standing on
the pavement looking up at the top windows," he
announced.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner nodded, and for a few seconds
stood blinking his eyes in earnest thought.
</P>

<P>
"Beudant!" he cried at last.
</P>

<P>
"Monsieu!" replied the negro.
</P>

<P>
"Where is Jussieu?"
</P>

<P>
"He has not yet returned, monsieur."
</P>

<P>
"Ah, ha! I see! He has either betrayed us or
been victimised. Beudant&mdash;a rope."
</P>

<P>
Beudant bowed and hurried from the room.
</P>

<P>
"What would you do?" demanded Dr. Vernet.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles shrugged his shoulders and cocked his
revolver. "We must quit Paris, or die in the
attempt," he replied. "Mr. Hume, if you wish to
live, you will be silent. Fulton, look out of the
windows again."
</P>

<P>
Dr. Fulton obeyed. "I can no longer see any
one," he reported.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles suppressed a curse. "They must be
on the steps, perhaps entering," he muttered. "Ah,
Beudant! Thank heaven! Bind him, Beudant.
Wait, my friends."
</P>

<P>
Even while speaking he left the room. The negro
passed a rope around my arms and in a trice I
was secured. I was wondering keenly what next
would happen, when of a sudden I heard a loud
swishing, creaking sound, as though a crane were at
work in the corridor without. The groaning of
wheels and chains was succeeded swiftly with a
dull, muffled crash, and a second later Sir Charles
returned.
</P>

<P>
"Dress quickly!" he cried to his friends. "We
have not a minute to lose. I have settled some of
them by springing the staircase trap, but the street
door is open, and there may be others."
</P>

<P>
He set the example himself by pulling on his
clothes with extraordinary rapidity. Vernet and
Fulton darted off, and I was left in the care of
Beudant, the only one who was completely attired.
If my arms had been free, I would have tried conclusions
with the negro. As it was, I helplessly
waited, gnawing my lip and silently cursing at my
folly. At the end of a few minutes a bell began to
tinkle in a distant portion of the house. Sir Charles
Venner started at the sound, and paused for a
moment, intently listening. The bell rang again.
Sir Charles threw a cloak across his shoulders and
tip-toed to the door.
</P>

<P>
"Hola! within there," cried a raucous voice in
French.
</P>

<P>
"All right!" shouted Sir Charles. "We'll be with
you in a moment; wait!"
</P>

<P>
I smiled grimly. For I understood, while my
enemy did not. Some passing policeman, observing
the street door open, had rung the bell in order to
inform the household of its carelessness. Sir Charles
Vernier, however, believed that one of my agents
had called out to his <i>confrères</i>, who had already
entered. A moment later Vernet and Fulton reappeared,
dressed as though for a journey. Sir
Charles then stepped behind me and put his pistol
to my ear. "Allons!" he muttered, "and tread
softly, if you wish to live."
</P>

<P>
Obeying the guidance of a heavy hand that
gripped my shoulder, I marched from the room
and began to climb the staircase towards the third
storey. The whole house was now wrapped in impenetrable
darkness. My captors, however, appeared
to know the way very well, and I was forced
without a pause along a maze of corridors, until we
were brought up by a wall. A match was cautiously
struck, and we entered a small unfurnished room,
the door of which was locked behind us. In the
middle of this apartment was a ladder that communicated
with the roof. Beudant climbed it with
the agility of a monkey and raised a trap in the
skylight, through which we all passed in quick succession.
As I emerged and stood erect, I saw a
sight I shall not easily forget&mdash;the magnificent panorama
of sleeping Paris. And yet Paris did not seem
to sleep. True, the night was dark, but in whatever
direction I glanced, I was confronted with
myriads of twinkling lamps that gleamed at me like
so many intelligent and baneful little eyes. I was
given but little time to digest the picture. Before
the muzzle of Sir Charles Venner's revolver I crossed
a slightly sloping roof of lead, and stepped over a
knee-high parapet of stone. Thence we traversed
the tops of three other houses and came at length to
a slightly lower edifice, which required some care to
reach. Beudant slipped over first, and I was bodily
lifted up by Fulton and Venner and dropped into
his arms. The roof perilously sloped, and the
journey filled me with tremors, for a mis-step meant
such a destruction as is entailed by a fall of sixty
feet upon a line of iron-spiked railings. But death
faced me on every side, so I set my lips and strode
forward. By great good hap I negotiated the pass
in safety, and came to a small, square ledge that
was faced with an attic door, covered with a tiny
gabled roof. A moment later we were all standing
in a long low ceiled chamber, into which we had
been admitted by a hideous old beldame. This
creature received us with chuckles of sardonic satisfaction,
and at once began to haggle with Sir Charles
Venner for a large sum of money which she claimed
to be her due. He tried to silence her by offering
half the amount demanded, but she indignantly
declined and threatened to scream. He therefore
yielded and gave her his purse. But while she
counted the money he turned his back, and taking
a phial from his pocket poured its contents on his
handkerchief. At a sign Beudant took the handkerchief,
and, throwing himself upon the old hag,
pressed it tightly to her nostrils. She struggled like
a fury, but the negro mastered her, and very soon
afterwards she was lying insensible upon the floor.
I was watching Sir Charles wrest from her clenched
hand his purse, when a terrible blow on my skull
deprived me of consciousness.
</P>

<P>
When I awoke I thought at first I must have died
in my sleep and have been thrust into hell. Every
fibre of my being was racked with pain. Darkness
encompassed me. With every breath I drew I was
sickened with noxious odours, and I could not move
a muscle. I tried to cry out, but could not utter a
sound. An iron wedge had been driven deep into
my mouth. My limbs were bound, and I was
tightly enclosed, in a doubled-up position, in a square
box. I lay upon my back and my knees were
trussed up across my chest so that my chin almost
touched them. I discovered these details slowly,
one by one, and gradually awoke to the fact that I
was still alive. For a little while I was glad to
know that, but with the passing hours I prayed for
death to end my tortures. Sometimes I swooned.
On awakening I invariably heard a monotonous
rumbling sound that was occasionally relieved by
long, shrill screams. It occurred to me at last that
I was being borne along upon a cart, the axles of
which badly needed oiling. I had at first mistaken
their screaming for the lamentations of lost souls.
Thirst was my greatest agony. It always increased,
while my other pains with time grew numb. Each
time I fainted I hailed the swoon as kindly coming
death, and for a brief moment I was happy. My
recoveries were accursed periods of anguish. But
I think my trances of insensibility grew ever longer
as my strength wore out. However that may be,
I began at length to dream, and I ceased to be able
to distinguish between sleeping and waking or even
to feel much pain. Then all of a sudden I felt a
rush of cool air on my brow, and I looked up into a
sky full of stars. Water was dashed on my face.
The gag was taken from my mouth and I was given
to drink. Someone clutched my arm and I shrieked
aloud. I was forced, still shrieking, to my feet, and
dragged by those I could not see through a plantation
of tall and stately pines. I swooned again.
And once more I awoke to find myself lying fully
dressed, but free, upon a bed of down in a cool and
pleasant room. It was morning. Through an open
window near my couch I could see a wilderness of
distant tree tops, larches, pines, and firs, and more
dimly between and above their branches a range of
hills beyond. A slant bar of sunlight streamed into
my chamber and, falling on the floor a dozen feet
away, marked out a golden pattern on the carpet.
Against the farther wall was a book-case filled with
volumes and an escritoire. A comfortable lounge
chair stood near the bed. I saw also a heavy
mahogany clothes press that was furnished with
mirror-backed doors. So totally unprepared was I
to encounter so gentle an experience that I rubbed
my eyes to make sure that I was not still dreaming.
The exercise obliged me to discover that my limbs
were frightfully stiff and cramped. I was not long
content, however, to allow my curiosity to remain
unsatisfied. By dint of a good deal of exertion, and
at the expense of many a sharp thrill of pain, I
climbed from the bed and essayed to rise. After a
few thoughts I succeeded, and then feeling dizzy, I
managed to totter to a chair. I had hardly sat
down when the door opened and Sir Charles Venner
stood before me.
</P>

<P>
"Good morning, Mr. Hume," said he, in quite a
genial voice. "I am glad to find you so much
better after your distressing journey here!"
</P>

<P>
"Are you?" I muttered stupidly. I was overcome
with surprise at his curious change of manner.
</P>

<P>
"Indeed, yes," he replied, and he smiled. "Do
you feel well enough for breakfast?"
</P>

<P>
I nodded.
</P>

<P>
"Then permit me to assist you. Ah, good!
Now take my arm."
</P>

<P>
He helped me, dumb with astonishment, out of the
room and along a passage into a fine old dining-hall,
that might have been part and parcel of some
medieval chateau, so quaintly and elegantly was it
furnished.
</P>

<P>
I could afford it no more than a glance, however,
for seated at table there were Dr. Fulton, Dr.
Venner, and Marion Le Mar, now Lady Dagmar.
</P>

<P>
At the sight of the beautiful woman whom I had
so passionately loved, I cried out loudly, and stood
still. Her face was pale. She was attired in deep
mourning, and her eyes were resolutely downcast.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner uttered a low, cynical little
laugh. "Quite a meeting of the clans!" he remarked.
"But come, Hume, I am certain you are
hungry."
</P>

<P>
Leaning heavily on his arm, I staggered to the
table and sank into a chair.
</P>

<P>
"Marion!" I gasped, looking at her straight and
full.
</P>

<P>
Very slowly she raised her eyes, and returned my
glance with a look of cold disdain.
</P>

<P>
I thought her a thief and a traitress, and yet my
eyes fell before her gaze.
</P>

<P>
"Will you try some oatmeal, Hume?" asked Sir
Charles Venner, who had taken the head of the table.
</P>

<P>
"No, thank you."
</P>

<P>
"Then, some ham and eggs?"
</P>

<P>
"Please."
</P>

<P>
Beudant entered the room. "The grave is dug,
master," he announced.
</P>

<P>
I looked at Sir Charles. He was biting his under
lip, and curiously regarding me.
</P>

<P>
"Whose?" I demanded.
</P>

<P>
"Yours and Lady Dagmar's!" he replied with a
sneer.
</P>

<P>
I looked at Marion. She was calmly eating her
breakfast.
</P>

<P>
"This is some ghastly joke!" I cried.
</P>

<P>
Marion glanced up and smiled. "Say cynical,
monsieur," she murmured quietly. "My good
friend, Sir Charles Venner, persists in believing that
we love each other&mdash;you and I&mdash;in spite of the fact
that scarcely a month ago I deserted you in order
to marry Sir William Dagmar."
</P>

<P>
"On his death-bed, madame!" cut in Sir Charles,
in tones of ice. "You forget that you are now a
rich young widow."
</P>

<P>
"Well, sir?"
</P>

<P>
"And that you have steadily refused to account
to me for his money, which should have been placed,
long ere this, at the disposal of our order."
</P>

<P>
"Sir William Dagmar bound me with an oath as
he lay dying&mdash;&mdash;"
</P>

<P>
"You have told me that story before," interrupted
Sir Charles. Marion shrugged her shoulders,
and put into her mouth a morsel of bread.
</P>

<P>
"Go on someone!" I cried impatiently. "See!
I am utterly in your power. Why not enlighten
me? Surely you are not afraid!"
</P>

<P>
Beudant placed beside my plate a cup of coffee.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles coughed behind his hand. "I am
only afraid that your appetite may be spoiled," he
observed.
</P>

<P>
"Not at all," I retorted. "Watch me!" I
began to eat, for in truth I was very hungry.
</P>

<P>
"We shall see," he rejoined. "You have a nerve,
I know, but keep on eating while I talk&mdash;if you can!"
</P>

<P>
I nodded.
</P>

<P>
"Jussieu was released last evening by a friend of
yours, a little man named Du Gazet, who induced
the manager of your hotel to break into your room."
</P>

<P>
"Well?" I gasped.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles laughed. "Jussieu is here," he said.
"He arrived two hours ago, and we know now that
you have no connection with the police. We were
fools indeed to allow you to frighten us away from
the Rue D'Enghien. But then everything always
happens for the best. We could hardly have disposed
of you properly in the city, unless we prosecuted
you for burglary, and such a course would
not have suited me."
</P>

<P>
"Do you intend to kill me?"
</P>

<P>
"Yes."
</P>

<P>
"When?"
</P>

<P>
"After breakfast."
</P>

<P>
"In broad daylight?" I asked, much astonished.
</P>

<P>
"Ah! Mr. Hume," he replied, "I read your mind.
But this chateau is placed in a wood, and is distant
seven miles from the nearest human habitation, and
as for the rest I had as lief destroy an enemy by day
as by night."
</P>

<P>
"Then I have not long to live?"
</P>

<P>
"As one measures time."
</P>

<P>
"And&mdash;Mar&mdash;Lady Dagmar?"
</P>

<P>
"You will die together. In each other's arms,
if you choose to be romantic."
</P>

<P>
I turned to Marion, to find her eyes fixed upon my
face. We gazed at each other for a long silent
minute, and then, overcome by some strange emotion,
I muttered brokenly, "Is it possible, after all,
that I have wronged you?"
</P>

<P>
"You have," she replied.
</P>

<P>
"Can you forgive me?" I asked hoarsely.
</P>

<P>
"It is late to make amends."
</P>

<P>
"I was mad to doubt you. But, God knows, I
suffered for it, Marion."
</P>

<P>
"Venner!" said Dr. Fulton suddenly, "can I
have a word with you?"
</P>

<P>
"Certainly. Vernet, Beudant, I leave our guests
to you."
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles got up from the table and walked to
the farther end of the room.
</P>

<P>
"They will not kill you, Marion?" I asked in
English. "Surely they are jesting."
</P>

<P>
"Yes&mdash;and no," she said. "Last night they
forced me to make a will leaving them my money.
They tortured me."
</P>

<P>
"How?" I gasped.
</P>

<P>
"They dragged me to the room where you lay
bound and senseless. If I had refused to obey they
would have cut you into pieces before my eyes."
</P>

<P>
"My God!" I cried. "And that broke your
will. But I would have deserved it all for doubting
you."
</P>

<P>
"Not quite," she answered, and she smiled in
exceeding sadness.
</P>

<P>
"Marion, dear Marion," I whispered, "you love
me still."
</P>

<P>
She looked up at me and her eyes filled with tears.
"How could you treat me so?" she muttered.
</P>

<P>
I felt the blood rush of a sudden through my
veins, singing a veritable poem of joy and triumph.
We were both about to die, but Marion loved me,
and by that knowledge I was transformed on the
instant from a weak half-broken creature into a life-loving
and most desperate man. I glanced quietly
about me.
</P>

<P>
While Dr. Vernet ate his breakfast he watched
me, but without manifesting suspicion. Beudant
stood behind his chair. Sir Charles and Fulton
were in earnest converse twenty paces off.
</P>

<P>
I thought to myself: "I may never get a better
chance. Only a coward will permit himself to be
slaughtered unresisting.
</P>

<P>
"Beudant," said I aloud, "will you be good
enough to get me another cup of coffee."
</P>

<P>
The negro nodded, and started to come round the
table.
</P>

<P>
"Dr. Vernet," I said as carelessly as possible,
"may I trouble you for the pepper-pot beside you?"
</P>

<P>
He bowed, and stretched out in order to render
me the indicated service. In a flash I had caught
his wrist in my left hand, and with my right I seized
a heavy carafe of water and hurled it at his head.
Next second I leaped across the table, caught him
in my arms, when, guided by Vernet's own instinctive
clutch to arm himself, I plunged my hand into his
breast pocket and found a revolver.
</P>

<P>
I slipped to the floor and held the stunned and
senseless body of Dr. Vernet before me as a shield.
Sir Charles Venner and Dr. Fulton were already
advancing towards me with drawn pistols.
</P>

<P>
"Stop!" I shouted.
</P>

<P>
Sir Charles Venner answered me with his revolver.
The bullet crashed into Dr. Vernet's brain and I
felt my face spattered with blood. I fired in return,
and Dr. Fulton, uttering a frightful scream, pitched
headlong on the floor.
</P>

<P>
It was a bad shot, for I had fired at Sir Charles
Venner.
</P>

<P>
For a moment thereafter the latter stood still,
and we stared into each other's eyes across the trail
of smoke. I became conscious that Dr. Vernet's
dead body was too heavy for me to support longer.
It was slipping from my grasp, slipping, slipping.
I realized that very soon I should be without my
shield. As at last it fell, I fired, twice in quick
succession. I heard an answering shot, then a
woman's piercing scream. I fired again. The room
was by then full of smoke; I could see nothing, but
I heard someone rushing towards me shouting and
cursing. For a fifth time I fired. There followed
the sound of a fall, then a deep and dreadful silence.
I waited with my revolver at full cock, not daring to
breathe, my every nerve on strain, listening and
peering vainly through the pall of smoke. Very
slowly and gradually the white mist lifted. At my
feet the woman I loved was lying very still. Blood
was welling in a rich crimson stream from a wound
in her breast. Beyond her Sir Charles Venner lay
face downwards on the floor. Both his arms were
extended at full length, and at a few inches from his
clenched right hand was his revolver. Beudant and
Dr. Fulton lay beside Sir Charles Venner's body.
All seemed dead. Oppressed with a wild and
hideous sense of unreality, I stared stupidly before
me. A smoke wreath, growing transparent, showed
me at length a living face. Jussieu stood within
the room, a black statue of horror. Scarcely conscious
of what I did, I raised my pistol and pointed
it at his breast. He did not move. I fired and he fell.

<P>
At the sound Marion's eyes opened. She looked
up at me. I uttered a cry of agony and, throwing
away my smoking weapon, I sank on my knees
beside her.
</P>

<P>
"Are you hurt?" she breathed.
</P>

<P>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;but you&mdash;you are wounded&mdash;you are
dying," I wailed.
</P>

<P>
She gave me a most wonderful and tender smile.
"For you," she gasped. "To save you! He
would have killed you&mdash;but his bullet is&mdash;here."
With a great effort she raised one hand and caught
at her breast.
</P>

<P>
"Oh, God! oh, God!" I groaned. "Marion,
you will not die and leave me! Tell me what to
do."
</P>

<P>
"Kiss me," she whispered.
</P>

<P>
But even as I stooped to obey, her spirit fled, and
I kissed the lips of a corpse. No other kiss shall my
lips know while I have life.
</P>

<P>
At the fall of noon I carried her from the house of
death and buried her in the grave which Sir Charles
Venner had destined for us both. It was in the
middle of a pine forest, and perhaps that is why the
saddest sound on earth to my ears is still the sighing
of pines. I left the bodies of my enemies where they
had fallen&mdash;accursed carrion! I would not have
touched them if I could. They were not discovered
until more than a week had passed, and by then I
was a thousand miles away, a desolate and broken-hearted
wanderer on the face of the universe. Many
years have passed and I am now a millionaire,
accounted by the world a hard-headed, flinty-hearted
financial magnate, and also something of a misogynist.
But I have recorded these chapters of my
history to show those who come after me, when I
am dead, that, rascal as I was, and abandonedly
selfish, I was yet capable of passion and of constancy,
and that no deep-seated hatred of the softer
sex has inspired the invincible solitariness of my
life.

<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Spectator</SPAN> says:&mdash;"The drawing of some of the characters indicates
the possession by Mr. Hocking of a considerable gift of humour. The
contents of his book indicate that he takes a genuine interest in the deeper
problems of the day."

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE MONK OF MAR-SABA.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Star</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Great power and thrilling interest.... The
scenery of the Holy Land has rarely been so vividly described as in this
charming book of Mr. Hocking's."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Manchester Guardian</SPAN> says:&mdash;"The author has turned his visit
to Palestine to good account.... His descriptions of the wild scenery
of different parts of the Holy Land are both vigorous and graphic, and
the stories themselves are interesting."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE PURPLE ROBE.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Queen</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Mr. Hocking's most interesting romance. It is
exceedingly clever, and excites the reader's interest and brings out the
powerful nature of the clever young minister. This most engrossing book
challenges comparison with the brilliance of Lothair. Mr. Hocking has one
main fact always before him in writing his books&mdash;to interest his readers
and he certainly succeeds admirably in doing so."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE SCARLET WOMAN.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Methodist Recorder</SPAN> says:&mdash;"This is Mr. Hocking's strongest
and best book. We advise every one to read it. The plot is simple,
compact and strenuous; the writing powerful. It brings out sharply
the real character of the typical Jesuit, his training, motives, limitations,
aims."

<P CLASS="noindent">
ALL MEN ARE LIARS.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Christian World</SPAN> says:&mdash;"This is a notable book. Thoughtful
people will be fascinated by its actuality, its fearlessness, and the insight
it gives into the influence of modern thought and literature upon the
minds and morals of our most promising manhood."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Standard</SPAN> says:&mdash;"A striking book.... It is strong and earnest
and vigorous; it shows knowledge of the lower class, and impatience and
contempt of shams of all sorts."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
ISHMAEL PENGELLY: AN OUTCAST.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Record</SPAN> says:&mdash;"As a story this book is a splendid piece of writing;
every detail is interesting, and the situations it creates are novel
and striking."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Athenæum</SPAN> says:&mdash;"The book is to be recommended for the
dramatic effectiveness of some of the scenes. The wild, half-mad woman
is always picturesque wherever she appears, and the rare self-repression
of her son is admirably done."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE STORY OF ANDREW FAIRFAX.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Manchester Examiner</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Rustic scenes and characters
are drawn with free, broad touches, without Mr. Buchanan's artificiality,
and, if we may venture to say it, with more realism than Mr. Hardy's
country pictures."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Liverpool Mercury</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Beautifully told. There are few
books better adapted to widen the mind and discipline the judgment
than this noble story."

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE BIRTHRIGHT.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Spectator</SPAN> says:&mdash;"This volume proves beyond all doubt that
Mr. Hocking has mastered the art of the historical romancist. 'The
Birthright' is, in its way, quite as well constructed, as well written, and
as full of incident as any story that has come from the pen of Mr. Conan
Doyle or Mr. Stanley Weyman."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
MISTRESS NANCY MOLESWORTH.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Scotsman</SPAN> says:&mdash;"'Mistress Nancy Molesworth' is as charming
a story of the kind as could be wished, and it excels in literary workmanship
as well as in imaginative vigour and daring invention.... It
would hardly be possible to tell a story of its kind better, or to leave
the reader better pleased at the end."
</P>

<P CLASS="noindent">
FIELDS OF FAIR RENOWN.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Scotsman</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Mr. Joseph Hocking's 'Fields of Fair Renown'
is a novel with a purpose, and the theme is worked out with a good deal
of force and effective power.... it is both interesting and powerful."
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Dundee Advertiser</SPAN> says:&mdash;"Mr. Hocking has produced a work
which his readers of all classes will appreciate.... There are exhibited
some of the most beautiful aspects of disposition."

<P CLASS="noindent">
THE PILLAR OF LIGHT.
</P>

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Evening Standard</SPAN> says:&mdash;"So admirable, so living, so breathlessly
exciting a book. The magnificent realism of the lighthouse and
its perils, the intense conviction of the author, that brings the very scene
he pictures before the reader's eyes with hardly a line of detached description,
the interest of the terrible dilemma of the cut off inhabitants
of the 'Pillar' are worthy of praise from the most jaded reader."

<P>
<SPAN CLASS="scap">The Dundee Advertiser</SPAN> says:&mdash;"The name of Louis Tracy on the
covers of a volume is a sufficient guarantee that the contents are worthy
of perusal. His latest novel, 'Heart's Delight,' establishes more firmly
than ever the reputation which he founded on 'The Final War'; like
that notable book it has a strong martial flavour."

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
